# Widget Monthly and Yearly Habits Display Fix

## Issue
Monthly and yearly habits were not showing up in the homescreen widgets when they were due.

## Root Cause
The `_isHabitScheduledForDate` method in `lib/services/widget_integration_service.dart` was missing the case for `HabitFrequency.yearly` habits, causing them to fall through to the default case and return `false`.

Additionally, the monthly habit case was using `habit.monthlySchedule` instead of `habit.selectedMonthDays`, which is the correct property used in `widget_service.dart`.

## Changes Made

### File: `lib/services/widget_integration_service.dart`

**Before:**
```dart
bool _isHabitScheduledForDate(Habit habit, DateTime date) {
  switch (habit.frequency) {
    case HabitFrequency.daily:
      return true;
    case HabitFrequency.weekly:
      return habit.selectedWeekdays.contains(date.weekday);
    case HabitFrequency.monthly:
      return habit.monthlySchedule.contains(date.day);
    case HabitFrequency.single:
      // ... single frequency logic
      return false;
    case HabitFrequency.hourly:
      return true;
    default:
      return false;  // ⚠️ Yearly habits fell through to here!
  }
}
```

**After:**
```dart
bool _isHabitScheduledForDate(Habit habit, DateTime date) {
  switch (habit.frequency) {
    case HabitFrequency.daily:
      return true;
    case HabitFrequency.weekly:
      return habit.selectedWeekdays.contains(date.weekday);
    case HabitFrequency.monthly:
      // ✅ Fixed to use selectedMonthDays for consistency
      final habitDay = habit.selectedMonthDays.isNotEmpty
          ? habit.selectedMonthDays.first
          : 1;
      return date.day == habitDay;
    case HabitFrequency.yearly:
      // ✅ Added yearly frequency case
      return habit.selectedYearlyDates.any((yearlyDateString) {
        try {
          final yearlyDate = DateTime.parse(yearlyDateString);
          return date.month == yearlyDate.month && date.day == yearlyDate.day;
        } catch (e) {
          return false;
        }
      });
    case HabitFrequency.single:
      // ... single frequency logic
      return false;
    case HabitFrequency.hourly:
      return true;
    // ✅ Removed redundant default clause (all cases now covered)
  }
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Monthly habits now properly display in widgets when their scheduled day matches
- ✅ Yearly habits now properly display in widgets when their scheduled date matches
- ✅ Code consistency between `widget_service.dart` and `widget_integration_service.dart`
- ✅ All enum cases are now explicitly handled

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create a monthly habit scheduled for today's day of the month
2. Create a yearly habit scheduled for today's date
3. Add both compact and timeline widgets to your home screen
4. Verify both habits appear in the widgets
5. Navigate to a different date and verify the habits don't appear
6. Navigate back to the scheduled date and verify they reappear
