# Alarm System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Alarms Not Working
**Problem**: Alarms were not triggering because the `android_alarm_manager_plus` plugin was disabled due to Gradle build issues.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced the problematic `android_alarm_manager_plus` with enhanced `flutter_local_notifications`
- Implemented proper notification-based alarms using `zonedSchedule` with `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle`
- Added full-screen intent and high-priority notifications for alarm-like behavior
- Maintained all alarm functionality without the Gradle conflicts

### 2. Limited Alarm Sound Options
**Problem**: Only 4 basic system sounds were available for selection.

**Solution**:
- Expanded to 12 total alarm sounds (4 system + 8 custom)
- Added custom sound support using `audioplayers` package
- Categorized sounds into "System" and "Custom" types
- Added variety including: Gentle Chime, Morning Bell, Nature Birds, Digital Beep, Zen Gong, Upbeat Melody, Soft Piano, Ocean Waves

### 3. No Sound Preview Functionality
**Problem**: Users couldn't preview alarm sounds before selecting them.

**Solution**:
- Added play/stop buttons for each sound in the selection dialog
- Implemented preview functionality for both system and custom sounds
- Auto-stop after 3 seconds to prevent annoyance
- Visual feedback with play/stop icons and color changes
- Proper cleanup when dialog is closed

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced AlarmService
- **Initialization**: Proper notification plugin setup
- **Scheduling**: Uses `flutter_local_notifications` with exact timing
- **Sound Management**: Dual support for system and custom sounds
- **Preview System**: Integrated audio playback with automatic cleanup

### UI Improvements
- **Enhanced Dialog**: Larger, more informative sound selection
- **Visual Categories**: Color-coded system vs custom sounds
- **Interactive Preview**: Play/stop buttons with visual feedback
- **Better UX**: Auto-stop, proper cleanup, loading states

### Asset Management
- **Sound Assets**: Organized in `assets/sounds/` directory
- **Flexible System**: Easy to add new custom sounds
- **Documentation**: Clear README for sound management

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Alarms**: No more Gradle build issues, alarms work consistently
2. **Better User Experience**: 3x more sound options with preview capability
3. **Professional Feel**: Categorized sounds with proper UI feedback
4. **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of system vs custom sound handling
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more custom sounds or features

## Usage
