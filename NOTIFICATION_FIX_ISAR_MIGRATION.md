# Notification Fix: Isar Migration Issue

## Problem
After migrating from Hive to Isar database, **notifications were not firing** for newly created habits.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Log Evidence
From `error.md`:
```
I/flutter ( 2970): ‚îÇ üí° üìã Found 0 active habits to schedule notifications for
```
This log appeared at app startup when there were no habits yet.

After creating a habit named "fghhj" at 15:38:
- ‚úÖ Habit was successfully saved to Isar database
- ‚úÖ Habit appeared in the UI with correct data
- ‚ùå **NO notification scheduling log appeared**
- ‚ùå Notification never fired at the scheduled time

### Code Investigation

1. **`main.dart`** - Schedules notifications only at app startup:
   - `_scheduleAllHabitNotifications()` is called once during initialization
   - This only schedules notifications for existing habits
   - New habits created after startup won't have notifications scheduled

2. **`create_habit_screen_v2.dart`** - Has misleading comment:
   ```dart
   // NOTE: Notification/alarm scheduling is handled by addHabit() in database.dart
   // to avoid double scheduling. Removed from here to fix performance issue.
   ```

3. **`database_isar.dart`** - Missing notification scheduling:
   ```dart
   Future<void> addHabit(Habit habit) async {
     await _isar.writeTxn(() async {
       await _isar.habits.put(habit);
     });
     AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Habit added: ${habit.name}');
     // ‚ùå NO notification scheduling here!
   }
   ```

**The comment claimed `addHabit()` would handle notification scheduling, but it didn't!**

## Solution

Added notification/alarm scheduling to database operations in `database_isar.dart`:

### 1. Import NotificationService
```dart
import '../services/notification_service.dart';
```

### 2. Schedule on Add
```dart
Future<void> addHabit(Habit habit) async {
  await _isar.writeTxn(() async {
    await _isar.habits.put(habit);
  });
  AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Habit added: ${habit.name}');

  // Schedule notifications and alarms for the new habit
  try {
    if (habit.notificationsEnabled || habit.alarmEnabled) {
      await NotificationService.scheduleHabitNotifications(habit, isNewHabit: true);
      AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Notifications/alarms scheduled for: ${habit.name}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    AppLogger.error('‚ùå Error scheduling notifications/alarms for ${habit.name}', e);
  }
}
```

### 3. Reschedule on Update
```dart
Future<void> updateHabit(Habit habit) async {
  await _isar.writeTxn(() async {
    await _isar.habits.put(habit);
  });
  AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Habit updated: ${habit.name}');

  // Reschedule notifications and alarms for the updated habit
  try {
    if (habit.notificationsEnabled || habit.alarmEnabled) {
      await NotificationService.scheduleHabitNotifications(habit);
      AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Notifications/alarms rescheduled for: ${habit.name}');
    } else {
      await NotificationService.cancelHabitNotificationsByHabitId(habit.id);
      AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Notifications/alarms cancelled for: ${habit.name}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    AppLogger.error('‚ùå Error rescheduling notifications/alarms for ${habit.name}', e);
  }
}
```

### 4. Cancel on Delete
```dart
Future<void> deleteHabit(String habitId) async {
  String? habitName;
  await _isar.writeTxn(() async {
    final habit = await _isar.habits.filter().idEqualTo(habitId).findFirst();
    if (habit != null) {
      habitName = habit.name;
      await _isar.habits.delete(habit.isarId);
      AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Habit deleted: ${habit.name}');
    }
  });

  // Cancel notifications and alarms for the deleted habit
  if (habitName != null) {
    try {
      await NotificationService.cancelHabitNotificationsByHabitId(habitId);
      AppLogger.info('‚úÖ Notifications/alarms cancelled for: $habitName');
    } catch (e) {
      AppLogger.error('‚ùå Error cancelling notifications/alarms for $habitName', e);
    }
  }
}
```

## Why NotificationService Handles Both

The `NotificationService.scheduleHabitNotifications()` method internally calls:
1. `_scheduler.scheduleHabitNotifications(habit)` - Schedules regular notifications
2. `_alarmScheduler.scheduleHabitAlarms(habit)` - Schedules system alarms

So we don't need to call `AlarmManagerService` separately.

## Testing Verification

After this fix, when creating a new habit, you should see these logs:
```
I/flutter: ‚îÇ üí° ‚úÖ Habit added: HabitName
I/flutter: ‚îÇ üí° ‚úÖ Notifications/alarms scheduled for: HabitName
```

And the notification should fire at the scheduled time.

## Files Modified
- `lib/data/database_isar.dart`

## Migration Note

This issue only affected the Isar migration. The previous Hive implementation likely had notification scheduling in the database layer, but it was lost during the migration to Isar.
