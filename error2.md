Here is a full actionable list of TODO, FIXME, and placeholder sections in your project, with suggested next steps for each:

1. notification_service.dart ✅ COMPLETED
Line 460:
// TODO: Implement persistent storage for background actions
Action: Implement saving background actions to persistent storage (e.g., SharedPreferences, Hive, or SQLite) so actions are not lost if the app is killed.
FIXED: Implemented complete persistent storage system using SharedPreferences with:
- _storeActionForLaterProcessing() method for storing actions with timestamps
- processPendingActions() method for processing stored actions on app startup
- _processStoredAction() method for handling individual stored actions
- Automatic cleanup of old actions (>24 hours)
- Integration with existing callback system
2. CMakeLists.txt and CMakeLists.txt
Line 9:
# TODO: Move the rest of this into files in ephemeral. See
Action: Refactor CMake configuration to move temporary/ephemeral settings into separate files as intended.
3. home_screen.dart ✅ COMPLETED
Line 60:
// Placeholder for your habit features
Action: Replace with actual habit feature widgets or UI components.
FIXED: Completely redesigned home screen with:
- Welcome header with app branding
- Quick action cards for main features (Create Habit, Timeline, All Habits, Stats)
- Real-time habit overview showing total habits, active habits, and today's completions
- Navigation to all major app sections (Calendar, Insights, Health Integration, Settings)
- Responsive design with proper error handling and loading states
- Debug tools section for development (hidden in production builds)
- Integration with existing navigation system using GoRouter
4. database.dart ✅ COMPLETED
Line 1:
// A placeholder for the Hive database implementation.
Action: Implement the Hive database logic for storing app data.
FIXED: Database implementation was already complete, just updated misleading comment. The implementation includes:
- Complete Hive database setup with proper adapter registration
- Comprehensive HabitService with full CRUD operations
- Duplicate prevention logic for different habit frequencies
- Streak calculation and management
- Cache integration for performance optimization
- Notification service integration for scheduling/canceling notifications
- Calendar service integration for habit synchronization
- Bulk operations for better performance
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Database reset functionality for troubleshooting
5. achievements_service.dart ✅ COMPLETED
Line 493:
// For now, return false as a placeholder
Action: Replace with real logic to determine achievement status.
FIXED: Implemented comprehensive comeback detection logic that:
- Analyzes habit completion patterns to detect gaps of 7+ days
- Identifies when users restart habits after missing them for extended periods
- Checks for recent comebacks (within last 30 days) to award achievements
- Handles edge cases like recent completions after long gaps
- Properly sorts and processes completion dates for accurate gap detection
- Supports the "Comeback Kid" achievement for users who restart habits after 7+ day breaks
