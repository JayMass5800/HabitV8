 üéØ RRule Advanced Pattern Capabilities

## Overview

The enhanced RRuleBuilderWidget now supports comprehensive recurring pattern options, covering nearly every possibility users might need for habit scheduling.

## üî• New Features

### 1. Interval-Based Patterns (Every N Units)

**What it does:** Allows habits to repeat every N days/weeks/months/years instead of just every single unit.

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ Every 2 days
- ‚úÖ Every other week (biweekly)
- ‚úÖ Every 3 months (quarterly)
- ‚úÖ Every 6 months
- ‚úÖ Every 2 years

**How it works:**
- Simple number input field: "Repeat every [X] [unit]"
- Automatic validation (must be > 0)
- Helper text shows examples:
  - "Every other day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday...)"
  - "Every other week (biweekly)"
  
**RRule mapping:**
```
FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2      ‚Üí Every 2 weeks
FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=3     ‚Üí Every 3 months
FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=2       ‚Üí Every 2 days
```

**UI Enhancement:**
- Info panel appears when interval > 1
- Shows contextual examples based on frequency
- Updates in real-time as user types

---

### 2. Position-Based Monthly Patterns

**What it does:** Allows scheduling based on the position of a weekday in the month (e.g., "2nd Tuesday").

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ 1st Monday of each month
- ‚úÖ 2nd Tuesday of each month
- ‚úÖ 3rd Wednesday of each month
- ‚úÖ 4th Thursday of each month
- ‚úÖ Last Friday of each month
- ‚úÖ Last Sunday of each month

**How it works:**
- SegmentedButton toggles between two monthly pattern types:
  - **On Days:** Traditional day-of-month selector (1-31)
  - **On Position:** Position + Weekday dropdowns
  
- Position dropdown: First / Second / Third / Fourth / Last
- Weekday dropdown: Monday - Sunday
- Live preview: "Example: The second Tuesday of each month"

**RRule mapping:**
```
FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1MO      ‚Üí 1st Monday
FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=2TU      ‚Üí 2nd Tuesday
FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=3WE      ‚Üí 3rd Wednesday
FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=4TH      ‚Üí 4th Thursday
FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR     ‚Üí Last Friday
```

**UI Enhancement:**
- Clear visual toggle between pattern types
- No confusion about which mode is active
- Helper text shows example in plain English
- Icons differentiate the two modes

## üìã Pattern Combinations

The system supports combining multiple features:

### Complex Weekly Patterns
```
Every other week on Monday and Friday
‚Üí FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=MO,FR
```

### Position-Based with Intervals
```
Every 2 months on the 1st Monday
‚Üí FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=1MO
```

### Multiple Position Days (Future Enhancement)
```
1st and 3rd Monday of each month
‚Üí FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1MO,3MO
```

## üé® User Experience Design

### Principles:
1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple patterns stay simple
2. **Helpful Examples:** Real-time preview shows what pattern means
3. **No Jargon:** "Last Friday" not "BYDAY=-1FR"
4. **Visual Clarity:** SegmentedButton makes mode obvious
5. **Immediate Feedback:** Preview updates on every change

### Helper Text Examples:

**Interval:**
- "Every other day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday...)"
- "Every other week (biweekly)"
- "Every 2 months"

**Position:**
- "Example: The first Monday of each month"
- "Example: The last Friday of each month"

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `lib/ui/widgets/rrule_builder_widget.dart` (1015+ lines)

### Key Additions:

1. **Enum for Pattern Type:**
```dart
enum _MonthlyPatternType {
  onDays,      // Traditional: Select days 1-31
  onPosition   // Advanced: Select position + weekday
}
```

2. **State Variables:**
```dart
_MonthlyPatternType _monthlyPatternType = _MonthlyPatternType.onDays;
int _monthlyWeekdayPosition = 1;  // 1=First, 2=Second, ..., -1=Last
int _monthlyWeekday = 1;          // 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, ...
```

3. **Enhanced RRule Generation:**
```dart
if (_monthlyPatternType == _MonthlyPatternType.onPosition) {
  final positionPrefix = _monthlyWeekdayPosition == -1 
    ? '-1' 
    : _monthlyWeekdayPosition.toString();
  final dayCodes = ['MO', 'TU', 'WE', 'TH', 'FR', 'SA', 'SU'];
  final dayCode = dayCodes[_monthlyWeekday - 1];
  parts.add('BYDAY=$positionPrefix$dayCode');
}
```

4. **Helper Methods:**
- `_getPositionPreviewText()`: Shows "The second Tuesday of each month"
- `_getIntervalExampleText()`: Shows "Every other week (biweekly)"
