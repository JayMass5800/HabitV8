# Infinite Loading Screen Fix

## Problem
App stuck on loading spinner, never reaching home screen.

## Root Cause
**Initialization Deadlock**

The strict `await _ensureInitialized()` in `getSubscriptionStatus()` created a deadlock:

```
AppLockWrapper builds
    ↓
Calls getSubscriptionStatus()
    ↓
Awaits _ensureInitialized()
    ↓
Waits for SubscriptionService.initialize() to complete
    ↓
But initialize() is running in background with 2s delay
    ↓
DEADLOCK - UI can't render, initialization can't complete
```

## Solution Applied

### Changed Files
- `lib/services/subscription_service.dart`

### Changes Made

#### Before (Blocking):
```dart
Future<SubscriptionStatus> getSubscriptionStatus() async {
  await _ensureInitialized(); // BLOCKS UI!
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  // ...
}
```

#### After (Non-Blocking):
```dart
Future<SubscriptionStatus> getSubscriptionStatus() async {
  if (!_isInitialized) {
    unawaited(_ensureInitialized()); // Fire and forget
  }
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  // ...
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **No Blocking**: UI can render immediately, doesn't wait for initialization
2. **Graceful Handling**: If trial start date isn't set yet, code handles it (line 114-117)
3. **Background Init**: Initialization completes in background
4. **Safety Net**: 3-second timeout in `_ensureInitialized()` prevents hanging

## Testing

### Expected Behavior
✅ App loads to home screen within 1-2 seconds  
✅ Trial status appears (may take up to 3 seconds)  
✅ No infinite loading spinner  
✅ No crashes  

### If Still Stuck
Check logs for:
```
⚠️ Initialization timeout or error, continuing: ...
```

This indicates initialization hit the 3-second timeout but app continues anyway.

## Side Effects

### Positive
- ✅ App loads instantly
- ✅ No deadlocks possible
- ✅ Better user experience

### Trade-offs
- ⚠️ Very briefly (< 3 seconds) subscription status might be based on cached data
- ⚠️ Extremely unlikely edge case: User could see "trial" for 1-2 seconds before premium status loads

### Mitigation
- `getSubscriptionStatus()` handles missing trial date gracefully
- `_hasPremiumSubscription()` always checks secure storage (accurate)
- 3-second timeout ensures initialization doesn't hang forever

## Deployment Notes

This is a **CRITICAL** fix - without it, app is unusable.

Priority: **P0 - BLOCKING**

## Related Issues

This was introduced in the recent premium fixes when adding:
- Initialization completer pattern (P1 fix)
- Race condition prevention

The fix properly balances:
- Race condition prevention ✅
- UI responsiveness ✅
- Data accuracy ✅
