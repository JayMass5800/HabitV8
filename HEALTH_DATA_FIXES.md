# Health Data Fixes for Heart Rate and Sleep Tracking

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Android Plugin Data Access Issues

**Problem**: The Android plugin was using reflection to access Health Connect record properties, which was unreliable and could fail silently.

**Fix**: Replaced reflection-based property access with direct property access:

- **Heart Rate Records**: Changed from reflection-based `getSamples()` to direct `record.samples` access
- **Sleep Records**: Changed from reflection-based `getStages()` to direct `record.stages` access  
- **Instant Records**: Changed from reflection-based `getTime()` to direct `record.time` access

**Files Modified**:
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/MinimalHealthPlugin.kt`

### 2. Sleep Data Time Range Issues

**Problem**: The sleep data query was using a restrictive time range (6 PM yesterday to 12 PM today) that might miss sleep sessions.

**Fix**: Expanded the time range and improved session filtering:

- **Expanded Query Range**: Now queries from 2 days ago to present to catch all possible sleep sessions
- **Smart Filtering**: Filters sleep sessions that ended within the last 24 hours to get the most recent night's sleep
- **Better Session Handling**: Properly calculates session end times using both timestamp and endTime fields

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/minimal_health_channel.dart` - `getSleepHoursLastNight()` method

### 3. Heart Rate Data Retrieval Issues

**Problem**: Heart rate queries were limited to 24 hours and didn't handle invalid readings.

**Fix**: Implemented progressive time range searching and data validation:

- **Progressive Time Ranges**: Tries 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, then 3 days to find data
- **Data Validation**: Filters out invalid readings (outside 30-220 BPM range)
- **Better Error Handling**: Provides detailed logging when no data is found

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/minimal_health_channel.dart` - `getLatestHeartRate()` and `getRestingHeartRateToday()` methods

### 4. Enhanced Debugging and Error Reporting

**Problem**: Limited visibility into why health data wasn't being retrieved.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive debugging and testing tools:

- **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed logs showing exactly what data is found and why it might be excluded
- **Test Connection Method**: New `testHealthConnectConnection()` method to diagnose issues
- **Debug UI**: Added "Test Connection" and "Refresh Data" buttons in the Insights screen (always visible) to show detailed health data status
- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Specific troubleshooting steps logged when no data is found

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/health_service.dart` - Added `testHealthConnectConnection()` method and improved debugging
- `lib/ui/screens/insights_screen.dart` - Added test connection button

### 5. Improved Resting Heart Rate Calculation

**Problem**: Resting heart rate calculation was limited to today's data only.

**Fix**: Enhanced calculation with fallback time ranges:

- **Progressive Time Ranges**: Tries today, then yesterday+today, then last 3 days
- **Better Accuracy**: Uses lowest 15% of readings instead of 10% for more accurate resting HR
- **Data Validation**: Filters out invalid heart rate readings

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Build and Install**: The app has been rebuilt with these fixes
2. **Check Logs**: Monitor the app logs to see detailed health data retrieval information
3. **Use Test Button**: In the Insights screen, tap "Test Connection" to see detailed health data status (button is now always visible)
4. **Verify Data Flow**: Check if heart rate and sleep data now appear in the health integration sections

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

- **Heart Rate Data**: Should now retrieve heart rate readings from your smartwatch if they're syncing to Health Connect
- **Sleep Data**: Should now capture sleep sessions from your smartwatch with improved time range handling
- **Better Diagnostics**: Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance when data isn't available
- **Robust Data Handling**: More reliable data parsing and validation

## Troubleshooting Steps for Users

If data still doesn't appear:

1. **Check Health Connect App**: Verify your smartwatch data is visible in the Health Connect app
2. **Sync Smartwatch**: Manually sync your smartwatch with its companion app
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure all health permissions are granted in Health Connect
4. **Verify Integration**: Confirm your smartwatch app supports Health Connect integration
5. **Use Test Button**: Use the "Test Connection" button to see exactly what data is available

## Technical Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No changes to the Health Connect permissions or manifest
- Improved error handling prevents crashes when health data is unavailable
- Enhanced logging helps diagnose integration issues
