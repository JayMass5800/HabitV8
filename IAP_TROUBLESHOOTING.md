## üìù Verification Checklist

- [ ] Product ID exactly matches: `premium_lifetime_access`
- [ ] Product status is "Active" in Play Console
- [ ] App published to Internal Testing track
- [ ] AAB version includes in-app purchase code
- [ ] Test account added to License testing
- [ ] Testing on real device with Play Store
- [ ] Using release build (not debug)
- [ ] Google Play Store app is updated

## üÜò If Still Not Working

1. **Wait**: Products can take up to 24 hours to propagate
2. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages in Flutter logs
3. **Contact Support**: Google Play Console support if product still not detected after 24 hours

## üìû Error Code Reference

- **BILLING_UNAVAILABLE**: Play Store app not updated or device not supported
- **ITEM_NOT_OWNED**: Product exists but not purchased
- **ITEM_UNAVAILABLE**: Product not found in store (main issue)
- **SERVICE_DISCONNECTED**: Temporary connection issue, retry

Your configuration looks correct in the code, so this is likely a Play Console sync/timing issue.
