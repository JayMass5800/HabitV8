# Verify GC Performance Improvements

## ‚úÖ What to Test

### 1. **Idle Behavior Test** (Most Important)
This verifies the polling timers are gone.

**Steps:**
1. Keep app open but **don't touch it** for 5 minutes
2. Watch logcat for GC messages:
   ```powershell
   adb logcat -s r.habitv8.debug | Select-String "GC freed"
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- **BEFORE optimization:** GC every 2-3 seconds (constant background activity)
- **AFTER optimization:** GC every 15-30+ seconds (only when Android needs memory)
- **No timer-related log spam** in logcat

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Zero "periodic" timer messages
- ‚úÖ GC frequency reduced by 70-80%
- ‚úÖ No log messages like "Checking notification callback" or "Widget update timer"

---

### 2. **Widget Update Speed Test**
This verifies the Isar listener is working.

**Steps:**
1. Complete a habit in the app
2. Immediately check home screen widget

**Expected Results:**
- **BEFORE optimization:** Widget updates after up to 30 minutes (polling delay)
- **AFTER optimization:** Widget updates within 1 second (instant via listener)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Widget shows completed status within 1 second
- ‚úÖ No 30-minute delay

---

### 3. **Midnight Reset Test**
This verifies the one-time timer pattern.

**Steps:**
1. Check logs around midnight (next occurrence: ~2h 16m from your last run)
2. Look for reset execution:
   ```powershell
   adb logcat -s flutter.habitv8 | Select-String "midnight"
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Reset executes at midnight
- ‚úÖ Log shows: `"üåô Performing midnight reset"` (or similar)
- ‚úÖ Timer is rescheduled for next midnight (not periodic)

---

### 4. **GC Baseline Comparison**

**Before Optimization (your original report):**
```
I/r.habitv8.debug: Background concurrent mark compact GC freed 11MB... (EVERY 2-3 SECONDS)
I/r.habitv8.debug: Background young concurrent mark compact GC freed 13MB... (EVERY 2-3 SECONDS)
```

**After Optimization (monitor for 5 minutes idle):**
- Should see **70-80% reduction** in GC frequency
- GC only when Android needs memory, not on fixed schedule

**How to Count:**
1. Start timer
2. Count GC messages in 5 minutes
3. **Before:** ~100-150 GC events
4. **After:** ~20-30 GC events (mostly during active use)

## üìã Quick Verification Checklist

Run these commands and check results:

### Check for Polling Code (Should Find Zero)
```powershell
# Search for Timer.periodic (should be empty or only deprecated services)
Select-String -Path "lib\services\*.dart" -Pattern "Timer\.periodic" -Exclude "calendar_renewal_service.dart","habit_continuation_service.dart"

# Search for timer re-registration (should be empty)
Select-String -Path "lib\main.dart" -Pattern "Timer\.periodic"
```

**Expected:** No matches (or only in deprecated services)

### Verify Isar Listener Registration
```powershell
# Check widget service has listener
Select-String -Path "lib\services\widget_integration_service.dart" -Pattern "_habitWatchSubscription" -Context 0,2
```

**Expected:** Should show StreamSubscription declaration and usage

## üéØ Success Metrics Summary

| Metric | Before | After Target | How to Verify |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **GC Frequency (idle)** | Every 2-3s | Every 15-30s | adb logcat GC messages |
| **Widget Update Delay** | Up to 30 min | <1 second | Complete habit + check widget |
| **Polling Timer Count** | 5 active | 0 active | Code search for Timer.periodic |
| **Background Callbacks/Hour** | ~1,860 | ~0 when idle | Logcat during 5-min idle test |
| **Battery Impact** | High | Minimal | Android Battery Usage stats (24h test) |

---

## üîç What to Look For in Logs

### ‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- `"‚úÖ Widget Isar listener initialized"` (on startup)
- `"üì° Now listening for habit changes"` (on startup)
- `"‚è∞ Next midnight reset in: XXh XXm"` (on startup)
- **No timer messages during idle periods**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Red Flags:**
- `"Timer.periodic"` in any logs
- Repeating messages like "Checking notification callback..." every minute
- GC messages every 2-3 seconds during idle
- Widget taking >5 seconds to update after completing habit

---

## üìä Long-Term Monitoring (Optional)

For comprehensive validation over 24-48 hours:

1. **Battery Usage:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí App battery usage
   - Compare before/after 24h periods

2. **Memory Stability:**
   - Monitor for memory leaks (app shouldn't grow unbounded)
   - Check Isar Inspector: https://inspect.isar.dev (linked on startup)

3. **User Experience:**
   - Widget responsiveness
   - Notification accuracy
   - Habit reset at midnight

---

## üö® If Issues Occur

### Widget Not Updating Instantly
**Check:**
```dart
// lib/services/widget_integration_service.dart should have:
_habitWatchSubscription = isar.habitIsars.watchLazy(...)
```

**Verify listener is active:**
```powershell
adb logcat | Select-String "Widget Isar listener"
```

### GC Still Frequent
**Check for leftover timers:**
```powershell
# Find any remaining Timer.periodic calls
Get-ChildItem -Path lib -Recurse -Filter *.dart | Select-String "Timer\.periodic" | Where-Object { $_.Filename -notlike "*_service.dart.bak" }
```

### Midnight Reset Not Working
**Check timer scheduling:**
```powershell
adb logcat | Select-String "midnight reset"
```
Should show one-time timer creation, not periodic.

## ‚úÖ Verification Complete When:
- [x] App launches successfully (DONE - you just ran it)
- [ ] 5-minute idle test shows 70%+ GC reduction
- [ ] Widget updates within 1 second
- [ ] No polling timer logs during idle
- [ ] Midnight reset executes correctly (wait for next midnight)
- [ ] Battery usage noticeably improved (24h test)

---

## üìù Notes
- GC during **app launch is normal** (you saw this in your flutter run output)
- GC during **active use is expected** (scrolling, database queries, etc.)
- **Idle behavior** is the key metric - should be nearly silent in logcat
- Widget updates are now **event-driven** via Isar's reactive streams

**Current Status:** Code deployed ‚úÖ | Testing in progress ‚è≥
