# Migration Archive

This directory contains the Hive-to-Isar migration code that was used during the database migration but is no longer needed in active development.

## Archived Files

### Migration Code
- **migration_manager.dart** (3,402 bytes)
  - Orchestrates the one-time migration from Hive to Isar
  - Checks SharedPreferences flag to avoid re-migration
  - Provides cleanup utilities

- **hive_to_isar_migrator.dart** (4,427 bytes)
  - Contains the actual migration logic
  - Migrates habits, completions, and all data from Hive to Isar
  - Validates migration success

### Old Database
- **database_hive_backup.dart.bak** (59,398 bytes)
  - Original Hive database implementation
  - Includes all Hive providers and services
  - Kept for reference only

## Why Archived?

**Date Archived**: October 5, 2025

**Reason**: Migration code was orphaned (not being called) after successful Isar migration completed.

**Status of Migration**:
- ✅ All app code now uses Isar exclusively
- ✅ Migration was successful
- ✅ SharedPreferences flag prevents re-migration
- ✅ No active code references these files

## Current Database Status

The app now uses **Isar database only**:
- Location: `lib/data/database_isar.dart`
- Providers: `isarProvider`, `habitServiceIsarProvider`, `habitsStreamIsarProvider`
- Multi-isolate support: ✅ Native Isar capability
- Used by: All services, widgets, notifications, UI

## If You Need to Restore

If for any reason you need to access this migration code:

1. **Copy files back**:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path "c:\HabitV8\archive\migration\migration_manager.dart" -Destination "c:\HabitV8\lib\data\migration\"
   Copy-Item -Path "c:\HabitV8\archive\migration\hive_to_isar_migrator.dart" -Destination "c:\HabitV8\lib\data\migration\"
   ```

2. **Update imports in migration_manager.dart**:
   ```dart
   import '../database_hive_backup.dart.bak' as hive_db;
   ```

3. **Call from main.dart**:
   ```dart
   await MigrationManager.performMigrationIfNeeded();
   ```

## Migration Safety

Even if restored and called, the migration has built-in safety:
- Checks `'hive_to_isar_migration_completed'` flag in SharedPreferences
- Returns immediately if already migrated
- Won't duplicate or corrupt data

## Notes

- Migration was designed as a one-time operation
- All user data successfully migrated to Isar
- Old Hive database files can be safely deleted from user devices
- This archive is for reference/emergency use only

**For reference only. Active development uses Isar database exclusively.**
