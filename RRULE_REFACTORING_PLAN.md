# 🔄 HabitV8 RRule Refactoring Strategic Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to refactor HabitV8's custom timing system to use the standardized RRule (Recurrence Rule) system based on the iCalendar specification (RFC 5545).

**Current Problem:** The existing system uses a fragmented approach with:
- `HabitFrequency` enum (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, single)
- Multiple separate fields for different frequencies (`selectedWeekdays`, `selectedMonthDays`, `hourlyTimes`, `selectedYearlyDates`)
- Scattered logic across 20+ files checking frequency types
- Difficult to add complex patterns like "every other week" or "third Tuesday of each month"
- Maintenance nightmare with switch statements everywhere

**Solution:** Implement RRule-based system that:
- Uses a single `rrule` string field to represent any recurrence pattern
- Centralizes recurrence logic in one service
- Supports complex patterns out of the box
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Industry-standard approach

       case HabitFrequency.hourly:
         return 'FREQ=HOURLY';
       case HabitFrequency.daily:
         return 'FREQ=DAILY';
       case HabitFrequency.weekly:
         // Convert selectedWeekdays to BYDAY
         final days = habit.selectedWeekdays.map((d) => _dayToRRule(d)).join(',');
         return 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=$days';
       case HabitFrequency.monthly:
         // Convert selectedMonthDays to BYMONTHDAY
         final days = habit.selectedMonthDays.join(',');
         return 'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=$days';
       case HabitFrequency.yearly:
         // Convert selectedYearlyDates
         // Complex: need to parse dates and create BYMONTH+BYMONTHDAY
         return _convertYearlyDates(habit.selectedYearlyDates);
       case HabitFrequency.single:
         // Single events don't repeat

- [ ] Add option to use RRuleBuilderWidget for advanced users (optional)

#### **4.2 Update Habit Creation/Edit Screens** ✅ IN PROGRESS → ENHANCED (Oct 3, 2025)

**Design Decision: Hybrid Dual-Mode UI with Smart Defaults**

After iterative refinement based on user feedback, we implemented a **user-friendly dual-mode approach**:

✅ **What We Built:**
- **Simple Mode (Default):** Familiar frequency selection (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)
  - Same intuitive day/date selectors users know
  - Auto-converts to RRule behind the scenes on save
  - Perfect for 95% of use cases
  
- **Advanced Mode (Optional):** Full RRuleBuilderWidget integration
  - Toggle switch with clear "Simple ↔ Advanced" button
  - Info dialog explaining differences with examples
  - Supports complex patterns: "every other week", "2nd Tuesday", etc.
  - Visual banner explaining current mode
  - Seamless switching between modes

- **Hybrid Hourly Approach:** 🆕 CRITICAL
  - RRule doesn't natively support multiple specific times per day
  - Solution: Combine RRule pattern + hourly times array
  - Both modes show hourly times selector for hourly frequency
  - RRule handles day pattern (which days to repeat)
  - hourlyTimes array handles specific times (9am, 2pm, 6pm, etc.)
  - Example: "Every weekday at 9am, 2pm, 6pm" = FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR + times=[09:00, 14:00, 18:00]

**🆕 Phase 4.2.1 Enhancements (Oct 3, 2025):**

**Bug Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed crash when switching to Advanced mode
  - Issue: `setState() called during build` error
  - Solution: Used `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()` to defer callback
  - File: `lib/ui/widgets/rrule_builder_widget.dart`
  - Documented in: `ADVANCED_MODE_CRASH_FIX.md`

**UX Improvements:**
- ✅ **Monthly Calendar View** (instead of number chips)
  - Visual calendar grid (7 columns × 5 rows)
  - Tap days to select/deselect
  - Clear visual indication of selected days
  - Shows count of selected days
  - More intuitive than FilterChips for dates
  
- ✅ **Multiple Position-Based Days Support**
  - Can now select multiple combinations (e.g., "1st AND 3rd Thursday")
  - New data model: `Set<_PositionDay>` with position+weekday pairs
  - UI: Add button to create combinations, chips to display/remove them
  - RRule output: Combines multiple BYDAY values (e.g., "BYDAY=1TH,3TH")
  - Use cases: "First and third Monday", "Second and fourth Friday", etc.
  
- ✅ **Enhanced Hourly Mode Explanation**
  - Detailed info panel in advanced mode when hourly selected
  - Explains difference between Simple and Advanced for hourly
  - Shows example: "Every weekday at 9am, 2pm, 6pm"
  - Visual distinction with icons, colors, bordered container
  - Clarifies why times are separate from RRule pattern

**Technical Details:**

New Components Added:
- `_PositionDay` class: Immutable position+weekday pair with equality
- `_buildMonthlyCalendarView()`: 5×7 calendar grid for day selection
- `_getPositionDayText()`: Human-readable position day text
- `_getMultiplePositionsPreview()`: Summary of all selected combinations
- Updated `_buildRRuleString()`: Supports multiple BYDAY position values

**Implementation Details:**

1. ✅ **`create_habit_screen.dart`** - DUAL MODE WITH ENHANCEMENTS
   - Added `_useAdvancedScheduling` boolean toggle
   - Added `_rruleString` and `_rruleStartDate` (dtStart) state
   - Created `_showSchedulingInfoDialog()` with clear examples:
     - Simple Mode: Daily, weekly on specific days, monthly on dates
     - Advanced Mode: Every other week, position-based (2nd Tuesday), intervals
   - Mode toggle button with visual indicators (icons, colors)
   - Info banner explaining current mode benefits
   - RRuleBuilderWidget integrated into advanced mode
   - Hourly times selector shown in BOTH modes for hourly frequency 🆕
   - Enhanced hourly explanation panel in advanced mode 🆕
   - Save logic checks `_useAdvancedScheduling`:
     - If true: Uses `_rruleString` and `dtStart` directly
     - If false: Auto-converts legacy fields to RRule
   - Hourly times always saved to habit.hourlyTimes array (hybrid approach)

2. 🔄 **`edit_habit_screen.dart`** - TODO (pending)
   - Same dual-mode approach needed
   - Parse existing RRule to populate advanced UI
   - Handle hybrid hourly patterns on load
   - Support parsing multiple position-based days

**Hybrid Hourly Architecture:**
```dart
// Habit model stores BOTH:
habit.rruleString = "FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR";  // Which days
habit.hourlyTimes = ["09:00", "14:00", "18:00"];         // Which times

// Services combine both:
if (habit.usesRRule && habit.frequency == HabitFrequency.hourly) {
  // 1. Get days from RRule
  final days = RRuleService.getOccurrences(...);
  // 2. For each day, schedule all hourly times
  for (final day in days) {
    for (final time in habit.hourlyTimes) {
      scheduleNotification(day + time);
    }
  }
}
```

**Multiple Position-Based Days Example:**
```dart
// User selects: "First Thursday" AND "Third Thursday"
_selectedPositionDays = {
  _PositionDay(1, 4),  // 1st Thursday
  _PositionDay(3, 4),  // 3rd Thursday
};

// Generated RRule:
"FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1TH,3TH"

// Human-readable:
"Repeats on: First Thursday, Third Thursday of each month"
```

   - Updated `_isHabitDueOnDate()` to check `usesRRule` flag first
   - Uses `RRuleService.isDueOnDate()` for RRule habits
   - Falls back to legacy frequency logic on error
   - Updated `_getHabitTimeDisplay()` to handle RRule habits
   - Graceful error handling with debug logging

2. ✅ **`calendar_screen.dart`** - COMPLETE
   - Updated `_isHabitDueOnDate()` to check `usesRRule` flag first
   - Uses `RRuleService.isDueOnDate()` for RRule habits
   - Falls back to legacy frequency logic on error
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing habits

3. ✅ **`all_habits_screen.dart`** - COMPLETE

### **PHASE 5: Data Migration** (3-5 days)
**Goal:** Migrate all existing habits to RRule format

#### Tasks:

1. **Create Migration Script**
   - `scripts/migrate_habits_to_rrule.dart`
   - Batch process all habits
   - Convert using RRuleService
   - Validate conversions

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Option A: Automatic migration on app update
   - Option B: Lazy migration (convert on first access)
   - Option C: User-triggered migration
   
   **Recommendation: Lazy Migration**
   - Less risky
   - Faster app startup
   - Individual validation

3. **Implementation**
   ```dart
   // In Habit class
   String getOrCreateRRule() {
     if (usesRRule && rruleString != null) {
       return rruleString!;
     }
     
     // Lazy migration
     rruleString = RRuleService.convertLegacyToRRule(this);
     dtStart = dtStart ?? createdAt;
     usesRRule = true;
     save(); // Save to Hive
     
     return rruleString!;
   }
   ```

4. **Validation & Rollback**
   - Create backup before migration
   - Validate each habit after conversion
   - Provide rollback mechanism
   - Log migration errors

5. **Testing**
   - Test with database of diverse habits
   - Edge cases (complex yearly patterns)
   - Performance testing with large datasets

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Migration script
- [ ] Lazy migration in Habit class
- [ ] Backup/rollback system
- [ ] Migration report/logs

---

### **PHASE 6: Legacy Cleanup** (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Remove old frequency system (optional, after stable RRule)

#### Tasks:

1. **Deprecate Old Fields** (Mark for removal)
   ```dart
   @deprecated
   @HiveField(19)
   List<int>? selectedWeekdays = [];
   ```

2. **Remove Switch Statements**
   - Remove all `switch (habit.frequency)` blocks
   - Keep only RRule logic

3. **Simplify Enum**
   - Consider removing HabitFrequency enum entirely
   - Or keep for UI convenience (maps to simple RRules)

4. **Database Cleanup**
   - Optional: Remove deprecated fields from database
   - Requires careful migration and testing

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Deprecated old fields
- [ ] Removed redundant code
- [ ] Simplified codebase
- [ ] Updated documentation

---

### **PHASE 7: Testing & Polish** (5-7 days)

## 📋 RRule Pattern Reference

### Current Frequency Type Conversions

| Legacy Type | RRule Pattern | Example | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Hourly | `FREQ=HOURLY` OR keep legacy | Every hour OR specific times | See hourly habits special case below |
| Daily | `FREQ=DAILY` | Every day | |
| Weekly (Mon, Wed, Fri) | `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR` | Every week on M/W/F | |
| Monthly (15th) | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15` | 15th of each month | |
| Yearly (July 4) | `FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=7;BYMONTHDAY=4` | Every July 4th | |
| Single | (No RRule - one-time event) | Oct 3, 2025 at 2pm | |

**Special Case: Hourly Habits with Specific Times**

The legacy "hourly" frequency is actually "daily at specific times" (e.g., 9 AM, 11:30 AM, 3 PM).
- RRule `FREQ=HOURLY` means "every hour" (not what we want)
- Better representation: `FREQ=DAILY` with time-based scheduling
- **Recommendation:** Keep `hourlyTimes` field for specific time management
- Hourly habits may remain on legacy system or use hybrid approach

### New Complex Patterns (Enabled by RRule)

| Pattern | RRule String |
|---------|-------------|
| Every other week | `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2` |
| Every 3 days | `FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=3` |
| Third Tuesday of each month | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=3TU` |
| Last Friday of each month | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR` |
| Weekdays only | `FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` |
| First and 15th of month | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1,15` |
| Every quarter (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct) | `FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=3;BYMONTH=1` |

## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Design Decisions

**1. Hourly Habits with Specific Times**
   - **Current System:** "Hourly" habits store specific times (e.g., 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM, 3:00 PM)
   - **Problem:** These aren't truly "hourly" - they're "daily at specific times"
   - **RRule Limitation:** `FREQ=HOURLY` means every hour (1:00, 2:00, 3:00...)
   - **Solution Options:**
     - Option A: Convert to `FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9,11,15;BYMINUTE=0,30,0` (complex, brittle)
     - Option B: Store multiple RRule strings (one per time)
     - Option C: Keep `hourlyTimes` field and handle separately (hybrid approach)
     - **Recommended: Option C** - Maintain hourly habit special handling
   - **Implementation:**
     ```dart
     // For "hourly" habits, check both RRule AND hourlyTimes
     if (habit.frequency == HabitFrequency.hourly && habit.hourlyTimes.isNotEmpty) {
       // Check if current time matches any of the hourlyTimes
       // This is a special case that doesn't map cleanly to pure RRule
     }
     ```
   - **Migration:** Keep hourly habits on legacy system OR convert to multiple notifications
   - **User Impact:** Hourly habits continue working as-is, no change to UX

### High Risk Areas

1. **Data Loss During Migration**
   - **Risk:** Habits lose scheduling info
   - **Mitigation:** Backup before migration, extensive testing, lazy migration
   
2. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk:** RRule parsing slower than current system
   - **Mitigation:** Caching, benchmarking, optimization

3. **User Confusion**
   - **Risk:** RRule UI too complex
   - **Mitigation:** Simple/Advanced modes, good defaults, previews

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Risk:** Breaking existing habits
   - **Mitigation:** Keep legacy support, gradual migration

### Medium Risk Areas

5. **Notification Scheduling**
   - **Risk:** Alarms not firing correctly
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive testing, logging, fallback logic

6. **Widget Updates**
   - **Risk:** Widgets showing wrong habits
   - **Mitigation:** Integration tests, widget test harness

### Low Risk Areas

7. **UI Polish**
   - **Risk:** Less intuitive UI
   - **Mitigation:** User testing, iteration

## 🎯 Quick Wins & MVP

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP) - 2 weeks
If you need results faster, here's an MVP approach:

**Week 1:**
- Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Core RRule service)
- Support only NEW habits with RRule
- Keep legacy habits on old system

**Week 2:**
- Phase 4.1 + 4.2 (Basic UI for new habits)
- Phase 3.1 (Core services updated)

**Result:** Users can create new habits with RRule, old habits continue working

### Quick Win Features
These could be implemented early to show value:
1. "Every other week" pattern (frequently requested)
2. "Weekdays only" pattern (common use case)
3. "Last day of month" pattern (useful for monthly habits)

---

## 🔄 Rollout Strategy

### Staged Rollout (Recommended)

**Stage 1: Internal Testing (1 week)**
- Developers only
- Test all scenarios
- Fix critical bugs

**Stage 2: Beta Testing (2 weeks)**
- 50-100 beta users
- Monitor crashes, errors
- Gather feedback

**Stage 3: Gradual Rollout (3 weeks)**
- Week 1: 10% of users
- Week 2: 50% of users
- Week 3: 100% of users

**Stage 4: Legacy Cleanup (After 1 month stable)**
- Begin deprecating old system
- Full migration to RRule

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (Phase 0 & 1)

### Critical Discoveries

**1. RRule Package API Quirks**
- ❌ **Wrong:** `getAllInstances()` - This method exists but causes infinite loops/hangs
- ✅ **Right:** `getInstances()` - The correct method per official documentation
- **Lesson:** Always read error2.md style documentation files - they contain critical implementation details

**2. DateTime UTC Requirement**
- ⚠️ All DateTime values passed to rrule package **MUST** be UTC
- Use `DateTime.utc()` not `DateTime()`
- The package ignores timezone but requires `isUtc: true`
- **Fix:** `final start = DateTime.utc(date.year, date.month, date.day);`

**3. Iterator Performance**
- ❌ **Wrong:** Using `.where().take()` on infinite streams causes hangs
- ✅ **Right:** Manual iteration with explicit break conditions
- **Example:**
  ```dart
  for (final date in instances) {
    if (date.isAfter(end)) break; // Critical!
    if (!date.isBefore(start)) occurrences.add(date);
  }
  ```

**4. RRule String Format**
- The package expects: `RRULE:FREQ=DAILY` (with prefix)
- Our storage uses: `FREQ=DAILY` (without prefix)
- **Solution:** Add prefix in `parseRRule()` method

### Testing Insights

**What Worked:**
- Minimal test files (`test/rrule_minimal_test.dart`) to isolate package behavior
- PowerShell job timeouts to catch hanging tests early
- Unit tests before integration - caught API issues immediately

**What Didn't Work:**
- Assuming documentation matched implementation
- Using `.where()` with infinite iterators
- Not checking DateTime.isUtc requirement upfront

### Performance Notes

**Test Execution:**
- Phase 0 & 1 tests: 11 tests in <1 second ✅
- Originally: Tests timing out at 60+ seconds ❌
- **Fix:** Correct API usage reduced runtime by 60x

### Git Strategy Success

✅ **Feature branch approach worked perfectly:**
- Main branch remains stable
- Can experiment safely on `feature/rrule-refactoring`
- Tag `v1.0-pre-rrule` provides instant rollback
- All changes tracked and reviewable
