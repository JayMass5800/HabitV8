## Coding Standards

### Dart Style Guide
We follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) with these additions:

### Code Formatting
- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use trailing commas for better diffs
- Follow Flutter's widget formatting conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `snake_case` (e.g., `habit_service.dart`)
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `HabitService`)
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase` (e.g., `habitList`)
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Use `///` for documentation comments
- Include examples for complex functions
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

### Example Code Style
```dart
/// Service for managing habit operations.
/// 
/// This service provides methods for creating, updating, and deleting habits,
/// as well as tracking habit completions.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final habitService = HabitService();
/// final habit = await habitService.createHabit(
///   name: 'Drink Water',
///   frequency: HabitFrequency.daily,
/// );
/// ```
class HabitService {
  /// Creates a new habit with the given parameters.
  Future<Habit> createHabit({
    required String name,
    required HabitFrequency frequency,
    String? description,
  }) async {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Testing Standards
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```dart
group('HabitService', () {
  test('should create habit with valid parameters', () async {
    // Arrange
    final service = HabitService();
    const habitName = 'Test Habit';
    
    // Act
    final result = await service.createHabit(name: habitName);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result.name, equals(habitName));
    expect(result.id, isNotEmpty);
  });
});
```
