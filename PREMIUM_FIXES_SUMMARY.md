## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 🔴 P0 - CRITICAL: Purchase Stream Listener (FIXED)
**Problem**: Device loss recovery broken - purchases not restored on reinstall  
**Solution**: Created global `PurchaseStreamService` initialized before `restorePurchases()`  
**Files**: 
- NEW: `lib/services/purchase_stream_service.dart`
- Modified: `lib/main.dart`

### 🟠 P1 - HIGH: Race Condition (FIXED)
**Problem**: Trial status could be wrong on first app launch  
**Solution**: Added initialization completer pattern to `SubscriptionService`  
**Files**: `lib/services/subscription_service.dart`

### 🟡 P2 - MEDIUM: Timestamp Validation (FIXED)
**Problem**: Legitimate purchase restorations rejected after 24 hours  
**Solution**: Relaxed validation from 24 hours to 30 days  
**Files**: `lib/ui/screens/purchase_screen.dart`

### 🟢 P3 - LOW: Trial Calculation (FIXED)
**Problem**: Users could lose up to 24 hours of trial due to time truncation  
**Solution**: Changed to hours-based calculation with proper floor division  
**Files**: `lib/services/subscription_service.dart`

### 🟢 P3 - LOW: Duplicate API Calls (FIXED)
**Problem**: Multiple `restorePurchases()` calls causing unnecessary API requests  
**Solution**: Removed redundant call in `_queryExistingPurchases()`  
**Files**: `lib/ui/screens/purchase_screen.dart`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Build and Test
```powershell
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build debug for testing
flutter build apk --debug

# Or use automated script
.\build_with_version_bump.ps1 -BuildType aab
```

### 2. Critical Test Scenarios

#### ✅ Test 1: Device Loss Recovery (MOST IMPORTANT)
1. Install app on device A
2. Make premium purchase
3. Verify premium access
4. Uninstall app completely
5. Reinstall app (same Google account)
6. **Expected**: Premium restored automatically within 5 seconds
7. **Success Criteria**: No manual "Restore" button needed

#### ✅ Test 2: Fresh Install

2. Install fresh
3. Launch app
4. **Expected**: Trial starts, shows "30 days remaining"

#### ✅ Test 3: Trial Expiry
1. Use debug tools: Settings → Trial Expiry
2. Restart app
3. **Expected**: App lock screen appears
4. **Expected**: Can access purchase screen from lock
