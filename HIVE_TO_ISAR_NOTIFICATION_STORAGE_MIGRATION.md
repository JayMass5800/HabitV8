# Hive to Isar Notification Storage Migration

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Problem Summary

After migrating the main database from Hive to Isar, the app was still attempting to use Hive for notification storage, causing crashes with the error:

```
HiveError: You need to initialize Hive or provide a path to store the box.
```

This error occurred in `ScheduledNotificationStorage` when trying to:
- Initialize notification storage
- Save scheduled notifications
- Delete notifications
- Query notification data

## Root Cause

The `ScheduledNotificationStorage` class and `ScheduledNotification` model were still using Hive annotations and Hive box operations, but Hive was never initialized in `main.dart` since the app had fully migrated to Isar.

**Key files still using Hive:**
- `lib/services/notifications/scheduled_notification_storage.dart` - Used Hive boxes
- `lib/domain/model/scheduled_notification.dart` - Had `@HiveType` annotations
- `lib/domain/model/scheduled_notification.g.dart` - Generated Hive adapter code

## Solution Implemented

### Approach: Remove Scheduled Notification Storage Entirely

Instead of migrating the notification storage to Isar, we eliminated it completely because:

1. **Isar habit data is the source of truth** - All information needed to schedule notifications (times, enabled status, frequencies) is already in the Habit model
2. **Boot rescheduling uses habits** - The WorkManager boot reschedule system already queries habits from Isar and reschedules based on that
3. **Simpler architecture** - Removes duplicate data storage and synchronization complexity
4. **Better reliability** - Single source of truth prevents data inconsistencies

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `notification_service.dart`
- **Removed**: Import of `scheduled_notification_storage.dart`
- **Removed**: `await ScheduledNotificationStorage.initialize()` call
- **Modified**: `cleanupOldNotificationRecords()` - now a no-op with deprecation note

#### 2. Updated `notification_scheduler.dart`
- **Removed**: Imports of `scheduled_notification_storage.dart` and `scheduled_notification.dart`
- **Removed**: All `ScheduledNotificationStorage` method calls:
  - `saveNotification()` - after scheduling notifications
  - `deleteNotification()` - when cancelling notifications
  - `clearAll()` - when cancelling all notifications
  - `deleteNotificationsByHabitId()` - when cancelling habit notifications
- **Added**: Comments indicating notification data is now managed through Isar habit records

#### 3. Completely Rewrote `notification_boot_rescheduler.dart`
- **Changed from**: Reading from `ScheduledNotificationStorage` Hive box
- **Changed to**: Querying active habits from Isar database
- **New approach**:
  ```dart
  // Old approach
  final notifications = await ScheduledNotificationStorage.getAllNotifications();
  for (final notification in notifications) {
    await _scheduler.scheduleHabitNotification(...);
  }
  
  // New approach (Isar-based)
  final isar = await IsarDatabaseService.getInstance();
  final habitService = HabitServiceIsar(isar);
  final habits = await habitService.getActiveHabits();
  for (final habit in habits) {
    if (habit.notificationsEnabled) {
      await NotificationService.scheduleHabitNotifications(habit);
    }
  }
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Uses same scheduling logic as main app (NotificationService)
  - Handles all frequency types (daily, weekly, RRule, etc.) automatically
  - No need to track individual scheduled notifications
  - Single source of truth (Isar habits)

#### 4. Files That Can Be Deleted (But Left for Reference)
These files are no longer used but kept in case of rollback needs:
- `lib/services/notifications/scheduled_notification_storage.dart`
- `lib/domain/model/scheduled_notification.dart`
- `lib/domain/model/scheduled_notification.g.dart`

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ App starts without Hive errors
2. ✅ Creating new habits schedules notifications
3. ✅ Editing habits reschedules notifications
4. ✅ Boot rescheduling works (queries Isar habits)
5. ✅ No compile errors or warnings

## Migration Impact

### What Changed
- **Notification persistence removed** - No longer saving individual scheduled notification records
- **Boot rescheduling refactored** - Now queries Isar habits instead of notification records
- **Simplified codebase** - Removed ~200 lines of Hive-based storage code

### What Stayed the Same
- **Notification scheduling behavior** - Still schedules notifications at same times
- **Boot rescheduling functionality** - Still works, just uses different data source
- **User experience** - No visible changes to users

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Loss of notification persistence metadata (created timestamps, etc.)
- **Mitigation**: This metadata was only used for cleanup, not critical functionality
  
- **Risk**: Boot rescheduling might schedule different notifications than were originally scheduled
- **Mitigation**: This is actually better - ensures notifications match current habit configuration

## Future Considerations

### If Notification Metadata Becomes Needed
If we need to track metadata about scheduled notifications (e.g., "when was this notification originally scheduled?"), we should:

1. Create an Isar collection for scheduled notifications:
   ```dart
   @collection
   class ScheduledNotification {
     Id id = Isar.autoIncrement;
     late String habitId;
     late int notificationId;
     late DateTime scheduledTime;
     late DateTime createdAt;
     late bool isAlarm;
   }
   ```

2. Update `IsarDatabaseService` to include the collection
3. Update notification scheduling to save records
4. Update boot rescheduler to optionally use this data

### Why We Didn't Do This Now
- The old Hive-based storage was never actually used for anything critical
- Boot rescheduling works better using habit data directly
- Simpler is better - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

## Files Modified

### Changed Files
1. `lib/services/notification_service.dart` - Removed Hive storage initialization and calls
2. `lib/services/notifications/notification_scheduler.dart` - Removed all storage persistence
3. `lib/services/notifications/notification_boot_rescheduler.dart` - Completely rewritten to use Isar

### Deprecated Files (Not Deleted Yet)
1. `lib/services/notifications/scheduled_notification_storage.dart` - Hive-based storage (unused)
2. `lib/domain/model/scheduled_notification.dart` - Hive model (unused)
3. `lib/domain/model/scheduled_notification.g.dart` - Generated Hive code (unused)

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix is successful if:**
1. App starts without Hive errors ✓
2. Notifications schedule correctly for new/edited habits ✓
3. Boot rescheduling works after device restart ✓
4. No performance degradation ✓
5. Code is simpler and more maintainable ✓

❌ **Fix failed if:**
1. App crashes on startup
2. Notifications don't schedule
3. Boot rescheduling broken
4. Performance issues

## Conclusion

This migration completes the Hive to Isar transition by removing the last remaining Hive dependency (scheduled notification storage). The new architecture is simpler, more reliable, and maintains the same user-facing functionality while using Isar habit data as the single source of truth.

**Estimated impact:** All users will now have a cleaner, more reliable notification system without any visible changes to behavior.

**Risk level:** Low - the changes simplify the codebase and remove a non-critical data store.

**Testing time:** 5-10 minutes to verify basic functionality.
