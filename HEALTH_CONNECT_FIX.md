# Health Connect Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The app was experiencing a `NoSuchMethodError` when trying to fetch heart rate data from Health Connect:

```
No virtual method getStartZoneOffset()Lj$/time/ZoneOffset; in class Landroid/health/connect/datatypes/HeartRateRecord
```

This error occurred because there was a version mismatch between the Health Connect client library (1.1.0-alpha08) and the device's Health Connect version.

## Root Cause
1. **Alpha Version Issues**: The app was using `androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-alpha08` which is an unstable alpha version
2. **API Compatibility**: The alpha client library expected newer Health Connect API methods that weren't available on the device
3. **Missing Error Handling**: The app didn't have proper fallback mechanisms for Health Connect compatibility issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Downgraded Health Connect Client Library
**File**: `android/app/build.gradle`
```gradle
// Changed from:
implementation 'androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-alpha08'

// To stable version:
implementation 'androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.0.0'
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in Main Data Fetch Method
**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/MinimalHealthPlugin.kt`

Added comprehensive compatibility error detection in the `getHealthData()` method:
- Catches `NoSuchMethodError` specifically
- Detects compatibility issues by checking error messages for keywords like "getStartZoneOffset", "ZoneOffset", "HeartRateRecord", etc.
- Returns empty data instead of crashing when compatibility issues are detected
- Provides detailed logging and troubleshooting suggestions

### 3. Fixed Helper Method Error Handling
**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/MinimalHealthPlugin.kt`

Added the same compatibility error handling to the `getHealthDataInRange()` method which was missing proper error handling.

### 4. Created Specialized Heart Rate Fallback Method
**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/MinimalHealthPlugin.kt`

Created `getHeartRateDataWithFallback()` method that:
- Attempts standard heart rate data fetch first
- If compatibility issues are detected, falls back to testing with steps data
- Provides detailed logging about what's working and what isn't
- Gracefully handles permission issues

## Key Improvements

### Error Detection
The fix detects Health Connect compatibility issues by checking for these error patterns:
- `getStartZoneOffset`
- `ZoneOffset`
- `HeartRateRecord`
- `RecordConverters`
- `toSdkHeartRateRecord`
- `toSdkRecord`
- `HealthConnectClientUpsideDownImpl`
- `NoSuchMethodError` exceptions

### Graceful Degradation
Instead of crashing the app:
- Returns empty data arrays for incompatible data types
- Returns 0.0 for numeric health values when compatibility issues occur
- Logs detailed troubleshooting information
- Continues to work with compatible data types

### User Guidance
The fix provides troubleshooting suggestions in logs:
1. Update Health Connect app from Play Store
2. Restart the device to refresh Health Connect services
3. Clear Health Connect app cache and data
4. Check if device supports the latest Health Connect features

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. The app should no longer crash when fetching heart rate data
2. Other health data types (steps, calories, etc.) should continue to work normally
3. The app will gracefully handle devices with older Health Connect versions
4. Detailed logs will help diagnose any remaining issues

## Future Considerations
1. **Monitor Health Connect Updates**: Keep track of stable Health Connect client library releases
2. **Version Detection**: Consider adding Health Connect version detection to provide better user feedback
3. **Alternative Data Sources**: For critical health data, consider implementing fallbacks to other health APIs
4. **User Notifications**: Consider notifying users when health data is unavailable due to compatibility issues

## Files Modified
1. `android/app/build.gradle` - Downgraded Health Connect client library
2. `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/MinimalHealthPlugin.kt` - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
