## 🎯 Critical Test: Device Loss Recovery

**This is the most important test - verifies P0 fix works**

1. Install app → Make purchase → Verify premium
2. Uninstall completely
3. Reinstall → **Premium should restore automatically within 5 seconds**

✅ **PASS**: Premium restored without manual action  
❌ **FAIL**: Shows "trial expired" or needs manual restore

## 📊 Test Results

Automated Tests: **20/20 PASSED** ✅

## 🔍 Key Log Messages

### ✅ Good (Should See)
```
✅ PurchaseStreamService initialized successfully
🔔 Global purchase update: restored for premium_lifetime_access
✅ Premium access activated from global purchase handler
✅ SubscriptionService initialized successfully
```

### ❌ Bad (Should NOT See)
```
❌ Purchase stream error
❌ getSubscriptionStatus called before initialization
❌ Failed to initialize PurchaseStreamService
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Premium not restoring automatically
**Check**: Is PurchaseStreamService initialized before restorePurchases()?  
**Log**: Look for "PurchaseStreamService initialized"  
**Fix**: Verify main.dart has correct initialization order

### Issue: App locked on first launch
**Check**: SubscriptionService initialization completing?  
**Log**: Look for "SubscriptionService initialized"  
**Fix**: Check _ensureInitialized() is called in getSubscriptionStatus()

### Issue: Purchase rejected as "too old"
**Check**: Timestamp validation changed to 30 days?  
**Log**: Look for "Purchase token is too old"  
**Fix**: Verify purchase_screen.dart has `inDays > 30` not `inHours > 24`
