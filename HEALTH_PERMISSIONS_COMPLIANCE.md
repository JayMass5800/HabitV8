## Data Usage Principles

### 1. Purpose Limitation

### 4. Local Processing
- All health data processing occurs locally on the user's device
- No health data is transmitted to external servers
- Health insights are generated using on-device algorithms
- Data remains under complete user control

### 5. Security Measures
- Health data is encrypted using device-level security
- Access is protected by device authentication (biometrics, PIN, etc.)
- Regular security updates and vulnerability assessments
- Secure coding practices throughout the application
