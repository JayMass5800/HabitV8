## Original Plan Below:

I. High-Level Concept
The goal is to create a beautiful, intuitive, and highly functional habit tracker that empowers users to build positive habits. The app will stand out through its visually stunning UI, intelligent insights driven by a local AI model, seamless user experience, and forward-thinking use of Android 16's advanced notification features.

II. Tech Stack and Architecture
Platform: Flutter (latest stable version, 3.32.8 as of August 2025, or compatible latest version at time of development).

Target SDK: Android 16 (SDK 36).

Language: Dart (latest compatible version, 3.8.1 or newer).

State Management: Riverpod. Its compile-time safety, robust dependency injection, and provider-based approach make it an excellent choice for a complex, scalable application with many different data sources.

Local Database: Hive or Isar. These are high-performance, lightweight, and modern NoSQL databases for Flutter, ideal for storing habit data, stats, and user preferences locally.

UI/UX:

Design: Edge-to-edge design using SystemChrome and SystemUiOverlayStyle for a full-screen immersive experience.

Theming: Full dynamic theme implementation with light, dark, and system options. Custom primary color selection will be available for user personalization.

Charts: Flutter_charts for standard charts, and a dedicated sunburst chart library like sunburst_chart for the stats screen.

Local AI: TensorFlow Lite (tflite_flutter package) will be used to run a pre-trained local model for data analysis and insights, ensuring user privacy and offline functionality.

Notifications:

Primary System: Android 16's Progress-Centric Notifications (Live Notifications) for real-time, interactive habit tracking directly from the notification shade.

Fallback System: Standard Android notifications (flutter_local_notifications package) with WorkManager for scheduled, background task handling for users on older Android versions.

Data Integration:

Calendar: device_calendar or add_2_calendar to handle bi-directional synchronization with the system calendar.

Health Data: health package to request and access relevant health data (e.g., step count) from services like Google Fit.

Permissions Handling: permission_handler package for a robust, user-friendly approach to requesting and managing permissions for notifications, calendar, and health data.

Project Structure: A layered architecture (e.g., Clean Architecture) separating UI, Business Logic (Domain), and Data layers to ensure scalability, testability, and maintainability.

III. Implementation Stages
Stage 1: Core Habit Functionality (MVP)

UI/UX:

Initial setup of the Flutter project with a basic, edge-to-edge design.

Implement the main navigation structure (Timeline, All Habits, Stats, Insights, Settings) using a state-of-the-art routing solution like GoRouter or a custom BottomNavigationBar.

Create a beautiful and intuitive habit creation screen with a form for hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly habits.

Integrate appropriate date/time pickers that allow for multiple selections.

Data & Logic:

Set up a local database (e.g., Isar).

Develop the data model for a Habit object, including a unique ID, schedule, category, color code, and completion history.

Implement the backend logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting habits.

Stage 2: Advanced Features & Android 16 Integration

UI/UX:

Develop the Timeline Screen: Display habits chronologically with color-coded status (red for missed, yellow for due, green for upcoming). Implement a top-of-screen category filter.

Develop the All Habits Screen: List all habits with the ability to filter by "Today" and "This Week."

Implement the Stats Screen: Create a stats page with encouraging language.

Implement a breakdown of best and worst performing habits.

Integrate a sunburst chart for habit categories and a timeline chart for completions.

Implement monthly and yearly tabs with placeholder text until enough data is available (e.g., "Build two weeks of data for a monthly report...").

Android 16 Specifics & Notifications:

Implement Android 16's Progress-Centric Notifications for habits that are due. The notification should be live, interactive, and update based on user input.

Create a robust fallback system for older Android versions using flutter_local_notifications for scheduled notifications and background updates.

Integrate the permission_handler package to request notification permissions gracefully.

Theming:

Implement full theme support (light, dark, system).

Add a feature in settings to allow users to select their own primary color.

Stage 3: Insights and Integrations

Insights Page:

Integrate a local AI model using tflite_flutter. The model will analyze habit data and provide personalized, encouraging insights.

Design and implement a badge system to award users for their progress and achievements.

Integrations:

Implement the health package to request health data permission and display correlations between habit completion and health metrics on the Insights page (if the user opts-in).

Integrate device_calendar to sync habit schedules with the system calendar, with an option to enable/disable this feature in settings.

Final Touches:

Ensure robust permission handling for all integrated features (notifications, calendar, health).

Conduct extensive UI/UX testing to ensure smooth, seamless navigation and a beautiful user experience across all devices.

Finalize and polish all screens, including the settings page with toggles for all configurable features.
