# Alarm Complete Button Enhancement

## Summary
Added functionality to the **COMPLETE** button on alarm notifications to mark habits as completed when tapped, in addition to stopping the alarm.

## What Changed

### Before
- Tapping "✅ COMPLETE" only stopped the alarm
- Users had to open the app to mark the habit as completed
- Inconsistent with notification complete behavior

### After
- Tapping "✅ COMPLETE" stops the alarm AND marks the habit as completed
- Works seamlessly in all app states (foreground/background/closed)
- Consistent user experience across all notification types

## Implementation

### New Components

#### 1. **alarm_complete_service.dart** (NEW)
Flutter service that handles habit completion from alarm notifications:
- Listens for completion callbacks via method channel
- Extracts habitId from callback data
- Marks the habit as completed using `HabitService.markHabitComplete()`
- Handles hourly habits with time slot parsing
- Logs all actions for debugging

### Modified Components

#### 1. **AlarmActionReceiver.kt** (MODIFIED)
- Added `ACTION_COMPLETE` handling
- Stores completion data in SharedPreferences
- Attempts to notify Flutter immediately
- Falls back to MainActivity intent if Flutter not running

#### 2. **MainActivity.kt** (MODIFIED)
- Added `COMPLETE_ALARM` action handler in `onNewIntent()`
- Invokes method channel `onAlarmComplete` with habit data
- Passes habitId and habitName to Flutter

#### 3. **main.dart** (MODIFIED)
- Added `AlarmCompleteService` import
- Initializes `AlarmCompleteService` with provider container
- Ensures completion callbacks are ready to be received

## Data Flow

### When User Taps "✅ COMPLETE":

1. **Android**: `AlarmActionReceiver` receives broadcast
   ```
   ACTION_COMPLETE
   ├─ alarmId: 123456
   ├─ habitId: "abc-def-ghi"
   └─ habitName: "Morning Exercise"
   ```

2. **Android**: Receiver stops alarm and stores completion data
   ```kotlin
   // Stop alarm service
   stopAlarmService(context, alarmId)
   
   // Store for Flutter
   prefs.putString("flutter.complete_alarm_pending_$habitId", habitId)
   prefs.putLong("flutter.complete_alarm_time_$habitId", currentTimeMillis)
   ```

3. **Android → Flutter**: Receiver notifies Flutter
   ```kotlin
   // If app is running
   channel.invokeMethod("onAlarmComplete", mapOf(
       "habitId" to habitId,
       "habitName" to habitName
   ))
   
   // If app is not running
   startActivity(intent.apply { action = "COMPLETE_ALARM" })
   ```

4. **Flutter**: `AlarmCompleteService` receives callback
   ```dart
   _handleComplete(habitId, habitName)
   ```

5. **Flutter**: Service marks habit as completed
   ```dart
   final habitService = await container.read(habitServiceProvider.future);
   await habitService.markHabitComplete(habitId, DateTime.now());
   ```

6. **Result**: Habit is marked as completed
   - Completion recorded in database
   - UI updates automatically via Riverpod
   - Widgets refresh to show completion
   - Stats and streaks update

## Special Cases

### Hourly Habits
For hourly habits with time slots (e.g., "habitId|09:00"):
- Parses habitId to extract actual habit ID
- Removes time slot suffix before completing
- Example: `"abc-123|09:00"` → `"abc-123"`

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing habit
- Logs all errors with stack traces
- Continues app operation even if completion fails
- SharedPreferences fallback for app restart scenarios

## Testing

1. **Create an alarm-type habit**
   - Set alarm for a few minutes in the future
   - Choose any frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)

2. **Wait for alarm to fire**
   - Verify alarm sound plays
   - Verify notification appears

3. **Tap "✅ COMPLETE" button**
   - Alarm should stop immediately
   - Notifications should disappear
   - Open app → verify habit is marked as completed
   - Check timeline/calendar for completion

4. **Test different app states**
   - Complete with app in foreground ✓
   - Complete with app in background ✓
   - Complete with app closed/killed ✓

## Benefits

✅ **One-tap completion** - Complete habits directly from alarm notification  
✅ **No app opening required** - Quick action without context switching  
✅ **Consistent UX** - Matches regular notification behavior  
✅ **Works offline** - No network required  
✅ **Robust** - Works in all app states  
✅ **Logged** - Full debugging support
