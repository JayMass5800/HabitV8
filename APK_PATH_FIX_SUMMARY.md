# APK Path Fix Summary

## Problem
When running `flutter run`, the service couldn't find APK files because it was looking in the wrong location. The build system was configured to output APK files to a non-standard path.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `C:\HabitV8\android\build.gradle.kts` on line 37:
```kotlin
rootProject.layout.buildDirectory = file("../build")
```

This configuration was redirecting the build output from the standard Flutter location to a custom path, causing APK files to be expected in the wrong location.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Build Configuration
- **File**: `C:\HabitV8\android\build.gradle.kts`
- **Change**: Removed the line `rootProject.layout.buildDirectory = file("../build")`
- **Result**: APK files now generate in the standard Flutter location: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\`

### 2. Updated PowerShell Scripts
Fixed APK path references in the following scripts:

- **`rebuild_with_all_fixes.ps1`**
  - Changed from: `c:\HabitV8\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`
  - Changed to: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`

- **`rebuild_with_fixed_permissions.ps1`**
  - Changed from: `c:\HabitV8\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`
  - Changed to: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`

- **`rebuild_with_permissions.ps1`**
  - Changed from: `c:\HabitV8\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`
  - Changed to: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`

### 3. Cleaned Build Artifacts
- Ran `flutter clean` to remove old build artifacts
- Ran `gradlew clean` to clean Android build cache
- Rebuilt the project to verify APK generation in correct location

## Verification
- ✅ APK files are now generated in: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\`
- ✅ All PowerShell scripts reference the correct path
- ✅ No references to the old incorrect path remain
- ✅ Build system uses standard Flutter APK output location

## Current APK Locations
After building, APK files can be found at:
- **Debug APK**: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`
- **Release APK**: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`
- **Standard Android APK**: `C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`

## Next Steps
The APK path issue is now resolved. You can:
1. Run `flutter run` - it will now find APK files in the correct location
2. Use any of the updated PowerShell build scripts
3. Build APKs using standard Flutter commands (`flutter build apk`)

All build outputs will now be in the standard Flutter locations as expected.
