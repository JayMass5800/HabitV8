# Notification Action Handler Fix

## Problem
The notification Complete and Snooze buttons stopped working after building the app. The error logs showed:

```
ERROR: To access 'package:habitv8/services/notifications/notification_action_handler.dart::NotificationActionHandler' from native code, it must be annotated.
```

## Root Cause
When Flutter apps are compiled in release mode (or with AOT compilation), classes that are called from native code need to be explicitly marked with the `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotation. This tells the Flutter compiler not to tree-shake (remove) these classes/methods even if they appear unused in the Dart code.

The `NotificationActionHandler` class was being called from native Android code when users tapped notification action buttons, but the class itself lacked the required annotation.

## Solution
Added `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotation to the `NotificationActionHandler` class.

### Changed File
`lib/services/notifications/notification_action_handler.dart`

### Code Change
```dart
/// Handles notification action processing and callbacks
/// Manages background/foreground notification responses, completion, and snooze actions
@pragma('vm:entry-point')  // <-- Added this annotation
class NotificationActionHandler {
  // ... rest of the class
}
```

## Why This Works
The annotation tells the Dart compiler that this class is an "entry point" that will be called from native code (Android/iOS), so it should:
1. Not be removed during tree-shaking optimization
2. Be accessible from native code through the Flutter engine
3. Preserve all its methods and static members

## Previously Working Annotations
The individual methods already had the correct annotations:
- `onBackgroundNotificationResponse()` - marked with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`
- `onNotificationTapped()` - marked with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`
- `_handleNotificationAction()` - marked with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`

However, the **class itself** also needed the annotation when these methods are called from native code.

## Testing
After applying this fix:
1. Clean build the project: `flutter clean`
2. Build release APK: `flutter build apk --release`
3. Install on device and test:
   - Notification Complete button should mark habits as complete
   - Notification Snooze button should reschedule notifications for 30 minutes later
   - Both actions should work from the notification shade
