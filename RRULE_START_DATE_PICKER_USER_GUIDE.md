# Bi-Weekly Trash & Recycling Setup Guide

## The Problem You Had
You wanted to create two bi-weekly habits:
1. **Trash** - Every other week (weeks 1, 3, 5, 7...)
2. **Recycling** - Alternating weeks (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8...)

**Previously:** Impossible because both habits would start on the same week!

## The Solution
The new **Start Date Picker** lets you offset the start dates by one week.

### Where to Find the Start Date Picker

When you're in **Advanced Mode** (or use "Custom Intervals"), you'll see:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Schedule Pattern              [Basic]            │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                  │

│ └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
│ ℹ️  For bi-weekly patterns, the start date      │
│    determines which week the pattern begins.    │
│    To create alternating schedules (e.g., trash │
│    vs recycling), set different start dates.    │

## Important Tips

### 1. **The 7-Day Offset Rule**
For alternating bi-weekly schedules:
- **Habit A Start Date:** Week 1
- **Habit B Start Date:** Week 2 (exactly 7 days later)
- Result: Perfect alternation

### 2. **Use the Same Day of Week**
Both habits should use the same day (e.g., both on Monday):
- ✅ Trash on Mondays, Recycling on Mondays
- ❌ Trash on Mondays, Recycling on Tuesdays (confusing!)

### 3. **Check the Preview**
The preview panel shows next 5 occurrences:
- Use this to verify your pattern is correct
- Make sure dates don't overlap between habits

### 4. **Pick a Memorable Start Date**
- Use the first occurrence you actually need
- Example: If trash is next Monday, use that Monday
- Makes it easier to remember which habit is which week

## Troubleshooting

### "My habits are showing up on the same weeks!"
**Fix:** Check the start dates are exactly 7 days apart (for bi-weekly):
- Trash: Jan 1
- Recycling: Jan 8 ✓ (correct)
- NOT Jan 9 or Jan 7

### "The dates don't match my actual schedule"
**Fix:** Adjust the start date to match when you actually need to start:
- If your trash day is next Thursday (Jan 4), use Jan 4 as start date
- Preview will update to show correct future dates

### "Preview shows wrong dates"
**Fix:** Double-check your settings:
- ✓ Interval = 2 (for bi-weekly)
- ✓ Correct weekday selected
- ✓ Start date is correct

---

## Summary

✅ **Simple 3-Step Process:**
1. Set start date for first habit (e.g., Jan 1)
2. Set start date for second habit (e.g., Jan 8 - one week later)
3. Use identical settings otherwise (both bi-weekly, both Monday)

✅ **Result:**
- Perfect alternating schedule
- No conflicts or overlaps
- Easy to manage

🎉 **You can now create your trash and recycling habits exactly as you wanted!**
