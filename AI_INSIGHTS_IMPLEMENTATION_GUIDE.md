## Data Requirements for AI Insights

### Minimum Thresholds
- **Habits**: At least 1 active habit
- **Completions**: Minimum 5 completions for meaningful insights
- **Time**: 2-3 days of consistent tracking recommended

### Insight Quality Progression
- **5-10 completions**: Basic pattern recognition
- **10-25 completions**: Improved trend analysis  
- **25+ completions**: Advanced correlations and predictions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Still seeing placeholder despite setup"
1. ‚úÖ Check API key is valid and saved
2. ‚úÖ Verify AI is enabled in settings
3. ‚úÖ Ensure minimum 5 habit completions
4. ‚úÖ Check network connectivity
5. ‚úÖ Look at debug panel for detailed status

### "API key added but not working"
1. Check API key format (OpenAI: `sk-...`, Gemini: `AIzaSy...`)
2. Verify API key has sufficient credits/quota
3. Test with different provider if available
4. Check for API service outages

### "No insights appearing"
1. Create and complete more habits (need 5+ completions)
2. Wait 24-48 hours for pattern recognition
3. Check if insights are falling back to rule-based (still valuable!)
4. Verify habit data is being saved properly

- "You're a morning person - 85% better completion rate before noon"
- "Health category is your strongest with 92% completion"

### With AI Enhancement
- "I notice you consistently skip workouts on Mondays. This might be because weekends disrupt your sleep schedule. Try a lighter Monday routine to ease back in."
- "Your reading habit thrives in the evening but struggles in the morning. Your brain might be more receptive to narrative content when you're winding down from the day."
