# 🚀 QUICK START - Test Isar Migration Fix

## ⚡ TL;DR - What Was Done

**Problem**: Widgets and notifications broken after Isar migration
**Fix**: Removed old Hive database files that were conflicting
**Status**: ✅ READY TO TEST

## 📦 Build & Install (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Build
flutter build apk --release

# Install
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## ✅ Quick Test (3 minutes)

### Test 1: Widget (1 min)
1. Create habit "Widget Test"
2. Add widget to home screen
3. ✅ Widget shows "Widget Test"
4. Tap to complete in widget
5. ✅ App shows as completed

### Test 2: Notification (2 min)
1. Create habit "Notify Test" with notification in 2 min
2. Wait for notification
3. ✅ Notification appears
4. Tap "COMPLETE"
5. ✅ Habit marked done in app

## 🔍 Check Logs

```powershell
adb logcat -s flutter | Select-String -Pattern "Widget|Notification|ERROR"
```

## ✅ Success Patterns

```
✅ Widget data prepared: 3 habits
✅ All widgets updated successfully
🔔 Scheduling notifications for all existing habits (Isar)
✅ Notification scheduling complete: 5 scheduled
🔔 BACKGROUND notification response received (Isar)
✅ Habit completed in background
```

## ❌ Failure Patterns

```
❌ ERROR: Failed to get habits
❌ Widget shows empty
❌ Notification not scheduled
❌ Background completion failed
```

## 🆘 If Something Fails

1. **Check Permissions**:
   - Settings → Apps → HabitV8 → Notifications → ON
   - Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization → HabitV8 → Don't optimize

2. **Check Logs** (see above)

3. **Rebuild**:

   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
