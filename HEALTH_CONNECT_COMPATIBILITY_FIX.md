# Health Connect Compatibility Fix

## Issue Summary

Your app is experiencing a **Health Connect API version compatibility issue** with the specific error:

```
NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method getStartZoneOffset()Lj$/time/ZoneOffset; 
in class Landroid/health/connect/datatypes/HeartRateRecord
```

**Root Cause**: Your device has Health Connect version `2025.07.24.00`, but your app uses Health Connect client library `1.1.0-alpha07` which expects newer API methods that don't exist in your device's Health Connect version.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Updated Health Connect Client Library

**File**: `android/app/build.gradle`

**Change**: Updated from `1.1.0-alpha07` to `1.1.0-alpha12`
```gradle
// OLD
implementation 'androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-alpha07'

// NEW  
implementation 'androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-alpha12'
```

**Reason**: The newer version has better compatibility with various Health Connect versions and includes fixes for the `getStartZoneOffset()` issue.

### 2. Enhanced HeartRateRecord Compatibility Handling

**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/MinimalHealthPlugin.kt`

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive compatibility detection for Health Connect versions
- Implemented multiple fallback methods for accessing HeartRateRecord time data
- Added pre-flight compatibility checks before making API calls
- Enhanced error handling to prevent app crashes

**Key Improvements**:
- **Version Detection**: Automatically detects problematic Health Connect versions
- **Method Fallbacks**: Multiple approaches to access HeartRateRecord data
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns empty data instead of crashing when compatibility issues occur
- **Detailed Logging**: Better diagnostics for troubleshooting

### 3. Compatibility Check Methods

Added two new methods:

1. **`checkHealthConnectVersionCompatibility()`**: Detects known problematic versions
2. **`checkHeartRateRecordCompatibility()`**: Tests HeartRateRecord API compatibility before use

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Clean and Rebuild

```powershell
# Clean the project
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate Hive adapters
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Clean Android build
Set-Location "c:\HabitV8\android"; .\gradlew clean; Set-Location "c:\HabitV8"
```

### Step 2: Build and Test

```powershell
# Build for Android
flutter build apk --debug

# Or run directly
flutter run
```

### Step 3: Monitor Logs

Look for these new log messages:

```
✅ Health Connect version appears compatible
✅ HeartRateRecord compatibility check passed
✅ HeartRateRecord.getStartZoneOffset() method is available
```

Or warning messages:
```
⚠️  COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Health Connect version 2025.07.24.00 has known compatibility issues
⚠️  HeartRateRecord compatibility issue detected - returning empty data
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Compatibility Issues Detected
- App will detect the compatibility issue
- Log detailed warnings about the Health Connect version
- Return empty heart rate data instead of crashing
- Continue working for other health data types (steps, sleep, etc.)

### Scenario 2: Compatibility Issues Resolved
- App will successfully retrieve heart rate data
- All health data types will work normally
- No more `NoSuchMethodError` crashes

## Alternative Solutions (If Issues Persist)

### Option 1: Use Stable Release

If alpha versions continue to cause issues, consider using the latest stable release:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.0.0-alpha11'
```

### Option 2: Disable Heart Rate Data Temporarily

If heart rate data is not critical, you can temporarily disable it:

```kotlin
// In MinimalHealthPlugin.kt, modify ALLOWED_DATA_TYPES
private val ALLOWED_DATA_TYPES = mutableMapOf<String, KClass<out Record>>(
    "STEPS" to StepsRecord::class,
    "ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED" to ActiveCaloriesBurnedRecord::class,
    "TOTAL_CALORIES_BURNED" to TotalCaloriesBurnedRecord::class,
    "SLEEP_IN_BED" to SleepSessionRecord::class,
    "WATER" to HydrationRecord::class,
    "WEIGHT" to WeightRecord::class,
    // "HEART_RATE" to HeartRateRecord::class  // Temporarily disabled
)
```

### Option 3: Update Health Connect App

Ask users to update their Health Connect app:
1. Open Google Play Store
2. Search for "Health Connect"
3. Update to the latest version
4. Restart the device

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Key Log Messages to Watch

**Success Indicators**:
- `✅ Health Connect client created successfully`
- `✅ HeartRateRecord compatibility check passed`
- `✅ Health Connect readRecords completed successfully!`

**Warning Indicators**:
- `⚠️  COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Health Connect version X has known compatibility issues`
- `⚠️  HeartRateRecord compatibility issue detected`

**Error Indicators**:
- `❌ Health Connect version compatibility issue`
- `❌ HeartRateRecord compatibility check failed`

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# View Health Connect logs
adb logcat | grep MinimalHealthPlugin

# Check Health Connect app version
adb shell pm list packages -f | grep healthdata

# Check app permissions
adb shell pm list permissions | grep health
```

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Monitor Health Connect Updates**: Keep track of Health Connect app updates and client library releases
2. **Version Testing**: Test your app with different Health Connect versions
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Always implement fallbacks for health data features
4. **User Communication**: Inform users about Health Connect compatibility requirements

## Support Information

If issues persist after applying these fixes:

1. **Check Device Compatibility**: Ensure the device supports Health Connect
2. **Verify Permissions**: Confirm all health permissions are granted
3. **Test Other Data Types**: Check if the issue is specific to heart rate data
4. **Update Dependencies**: Consider updating to newer client library versions as they become available

## Technical Details

### Health Connect Version Compatibility Matrix

| Health Connect Version | Client Library | Status | Issues |
|----------------------|----------------|--------|---------|
| 2025.07.24.00 | 1.1.0-alpha07 | ❌ Incompatible | getStartZoneOffset() |
| 2025.07.24.00 | 1.1.0-alpha12 | ✅ Compatible | Fixed |
| 2025.08.x.x | 1.1.0-alpha12 | ✅ Compatible | Should work |

### API Method Compatibility

| Method | Health Connect 2025.07.24.00 | Client Library Expectation |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `getStartZoneOffset()` | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Expected |
| `getEndZoneOffset()` | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Expected |
| `time` property | ✅ Available | ✅ Expected |
| `samples` property | ✅ Available | ✅ Expected |

The fix implements multiple fallback methods to handle these compatibility differences gracefully.
