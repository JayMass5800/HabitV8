- **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to original thresholds when confidence is low
- **Reason Tracking**: Provides explanations for threshold adjustments

### 2. Learning System
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from both automatic and manual completions
- **Weekly Patterns**: Adjusts for day-of-week variations
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Accounts for longer-term trends
- **Data Persistence**: Stores learning data in SharedPreferences

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks accuracy, false positives, and confidence
- **Habit-Specific Stats**: Individual statistics per habit
- **System-Wide Analytics**: Overall system performance monitoring
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance tracking

### 4. User Interface
- **Settings Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing settings
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live service status updates
- **Configuration Controls**: Fine-tuned control over learning parameters
- **Demo System**: Interactive demonstration of capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structure
```dart
class SmartThresholdResult {
  final double threshold;      // Calculated adaptive threshold
  final double confidence;     // Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
  final String reason;         // Explanation for adjustment
  final bool isAdapted;        // Whether threshold was modified
}
```

### Learning Data Format
```dart
{
  'habitId': [
    {
      'date': timestamp,
      'healthDataType': 'STEPS',
      'healthValue': 7500.0,
      'usedThreshold': 5000.0,
      'wasAutoCompleted': true,
      'wasManuallyCompleted': false,
      'dayOfWeek': 1,
      'confidence': 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options
- **Learning Sensitivity**: Controls how quickly the system adapts (0.1-1.0)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence required for adjustments (0.5-0.95)
- **Smart Thresholds Enabled**: Master toggle for the entire system
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enhanced responsiveness vs. battery optimization

## Integration Points

### 1. Automatic Habit Completion Service
- Enhanced `_shouldCompleteHabit()` method to use adaptive thresholds
- Added learning integration in completion workflow
- Smart threshold configuration methods

### 2. Health Data Integration
- Works with existing health data types (STEPS, HEART_RATE, etc.)
- Leverages existing health data sync infrastructure
- Maintains compatibility with manual completion workflows

### 3. Settings System
- Integrated into existing settings hierarchy
- Conditional display based on feature enablement
- Consistent UI/UX with existing settings patterns

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Learning data cached in memory with 30-second expiry
- Threshold calculations cached per habit per day
- Minimal impact on app startup time

### 2. Background Processing
- Learning occurs asynchronously after completions
- Threshold calculations are lightweight and fast
- No blocking operations in UI thread

### 3. Data Storage
- Uses SharedPreferences for persistence
- Automatic cleanup of old learning data (>90 days)
- Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization

## Error Handling

### 1. Graceful Degradation
- Falls back to original thresholds on calculation errors
- Continues operation even with corrupted learning data
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 2. Data Validation
- Validates learning data integrity on load
- Handles missing or malformed configuration gracefully
- Automatic recovery from invalid states

### 3. User Experience
- No user-visible errors during normal operation
- Clear feedback in settings when issues occur
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Configuration Recommendations

### For New Users
- Start with default settings (sensitivity: 0.5, confidence: 0.7)
- Enable smart thresholds after 1-2 weeks of usage
- Monitor performance through settings dashboard

### For Power Users
- Increase sensitivity (0.7-0.8) for faster adaptation
- Lower confidence threshold (0.6) for more aggressive adjustments
- Enable real-time monitoring for immediate feedback

### For Battery-Conscious Users
- Use default sensitivity (0.5) or lower
- Disable real-time monitoring
- Rely on scheduled background processing
