ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETE SOLUTION SUMMARY
ðŸ”¥ THE ROOT PROBLEM
Google Play Console's static analysis was detecting health permissions from the Flutter health plugin (v13.1.1), even though your app only used 6 specific health data types. The plugin includes metadata for ALL possible health permissions, triggering the health policy requirements.

âœ… OUR SOLUTION: Complete Plugin Replacement
1. Removed the Problematic Plugin
# REMOVED from pubspec.yaml:
# health: ^13.1.1  # This was causing the issue
2. Created Custom Minimal Implementation
MinimalHealthService: Dart service that only handles 6 data types
MinimalHealthPlugin.kt: Android native plugin with strict validation
HealthService: Wrapper maintaining API compatibility
3. Strict Permission Control
ONLY these 6 permissions are supported:

âœ… android.permission.health.READ_STEPS
âœ… android.permission.health.READ_ACTIVE_CALORIES_BURNED
âœ… android.permission.health.READ_SLEEP
âœ… android.permission.health.READ_HYDRATION
âœ… android.permission.health.READ_MINDFULNESS
âœ… android.permission.health.READ_WEIGHT
ALL other health permissions are blocked at multiple levels.

4. Multi-Layer Protection
Code Level: Runtime validation prevents forbidden data types
Manifest Level: Explicit removal of unwanted permissions
Native Level: Android plugin validates all requests
Build Level: ProGuard rules strip unused metadata
ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED RESULT
After this solution:

Google Play Console should NOT detect unwanted health permissions
The health policy warning should disappear
Your app should be approved without health compliance issues
