# Background Notification Handler Changes

## Summary
Updated the notification service to properly handle background notification responses with async processing and direct habit completion.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Imports
**File:** `lib/services/notification_service.dart`

Added the following imports:
```dart
import 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';
import 'widget_integration_service.dart';
```

### 2. Made Background Handler Async
Changed the `onBackgroundNotificationResponse` method signature from:
```dart
static void onBackgroundNotificationResponse(
  NotificationResponse notificationResponse,
)
```

To:
```dart
static Future<void> onBackgroundNotificationResponse(
  NotificationResponse notificationResponse,
) async
```

This allows the handler to properly await async operations in the background.

### 3. Updated Background Handler Logic
The handler now:
- Processes completions directly using `_completeHabitInBackground()`
- Handles snooze actions in the background
- Removes stored actions after successful processing
- Falls back to storing actions if processing fails

### 4. Created `_completeHabitInBackground()` Method
**Location:** `lib/services/notification_service.dart` (after `onBackgroundNotificationResponse`)

This new method:
- Initializes Hive independently if needed
- Registers required adapters (HabitAdapter, HabitFrequencyAdapter, HabitDifficultyAdapter)
- Opens the habits box directly
- Processes habit completions without relying on app context
- Updates streaks and saves to database
- Triggers widget updates after completion
- Handles hourly habits with time slots
- Checks if habit is already completed for the period

### 5. Added Helper Methods
Created two helper methods for background processing:

**`_isHabitCompletedForPeriod()`**
- Checks if a habit is already completed for its frequency period
- Supports all frequency types (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, single, hourly)

**`_calculateStreak()`**
- Calculates the current streak for a habit
- Sorts completions and counts consecutive days

### 6. Changed `showsUserInterface` to `false`
Updated all `AndroidNotificationAction` instances to use `showsUserInterface: false` for proper background execution:

**Locations:**
- Regular habit notifications (complete/snooze actions)
- Scheduled habit notifications (complete/snooze actions)
- Alarm notifications (complete/snooze_alarm actions)

This ensures that notification actions can be processed in the background without requiring the app to be brought to the foreground.

## Benefits

1. **True Background Processing**: Notifications can now be acted upon even when the app is completely closed
2. **Independent Operation**: The background handler doesn't rely on the app's provider container or services
3. **Reliable Completion**: Habits are marked complete directly in the database with proper streak calculation
4. **Widget Updates**: Home screen widgets are updated immediately after background completion
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: If background processing fails, actions are stored for later processing when the app opens

## Technical Details

### Hive Initialization in Background
The background handler safely initializes Hive if it's not already open:
```dart
if (!Hive.isBoxOpen('habits')) {
  await Hive.initFlutter();
  // Register adapters...
}
```

### Adapter Registration
Properly registers all required Hive type adapters:
- Type ID 0: HabitAdapter
- Type ID 1: HabitFrequencyAdapter
- Type ID 2: HabitDifficultyAdapter

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback to stored actions if processing fails
- Stack trace logging for errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with app completely closed (force stop)
2. Test with app in background
3. Test with different habit frequencies (daily, weekly, hourly, etc.)
4. Test both complete and snooze actions
5. Verify widget updates after background completion
6. Check that streaks are calculated correctly
7. Verify no duplicate completions are created

## Notes

- The `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotation is critical for background execution
- The handler must be a top-level or static function
- Hive must be initialized before accessing the database
- Widget updates may have limited functionality in true background mode
