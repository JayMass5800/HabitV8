Optimize Performance of Key Screens in Flutter Habit Tracking App
Objective:
Refactor and optimize the Timeline, Create Habit, and Edit Habit screens in our Flutter-based habit tracking app to eliminate sluggishness, UI lag, and processing delays. The goal is to achieve an ultra-responsive, smooth user experience without altering any existing features or UI design.
Problem Description
The application is currently suffering from significant performance bottlenecks on several key screens, leading to a poor user experience. The specific issues are:
General Sluggishness: The main Timeline screen, as well as the Create and Edit Habit screens, are slow and unresponsive to user input. Scrolling and navigation feel janky.
Habit Completion Delay: When a user marks a habit as "complete," there is a noticeable delay (several seconds) before the UI updates to reflect this change. This lag is long enough for users to believe the action failed.
Habit Creation Failure & Duplication: The Create Habit screen is extremely slow when saving. After pressing the "Save" button, the app freezes or appears to have crashed. This leads users to tap the "Save" button multiple times. When the app eventually processes the requests, it results in multiple duplicate entries of the same habit.
Scope and Requirements
Your task is to identify the root causes of these performance issues and rebuild the necessary components to fix them.
Performance Analysis: Begin by using Flutter DevTools to profile the app and identify the specific bottlenecks causing UI jank, slow state updates, and long processing times.
Code Refactoring: Refactor the widget builds, state management logic, and data handling on the affected screens. This may involve:
Optimizing widget rebuilds (e.g., using const constructors, breaking down large widgets).
Evaluating and potentially restructuring the state management solution to prevent unnecessary UI updates.
Ensuring all database and network operations are performed asynchronously and do not block the UI thread.
Immediate User Feedback: Implement mechanisms to provide immediate feedback for long-running actions.
When saving a new or edited habit, the "Save" button must be disabled immediately after the first tap, and a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) should be displayed to prevent multiple submissions.
When completing a habit, the UI should update optimistically or show a loading state instantly.
Constraints
No Feature Changes: All existing functionality must be preserved. The user flow and features should work exactly as they do now, just faster.
No Design Changes: The UI and UX design, including layouts, colors, fonts, and styling, must remain identical to the current version.
Acceptance Criteria
The project will be considered complete when the following criteria are met:
✅ The Timeline screen scrolls smoothly, even with a large number of habits.
✅ The Create and Edit screens load instantly and respond immediately to user input.
✅ Marking a habit as complete provides an instantaneous visual update on the UI.
✅ Saving a new habit provides immediate visual feedback (e.g., loading state) and successfully saves only one instance of the habit, regardless of how many times the user taps the save button.
✅ The overall app feels snappy, responsive, and free of freezes or noticeable lag.
