Apps targeting Android 15 or later cannot use BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast receivers to launch certain foreground service types. Doing this will cause your app to crash for users on Android 15 and later. Your app starts restricted foreground service types using BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast receivers in the following places:
com.habittracker.habitv8.AlarmService.onStartCommand
To resolve this issue, make sure that BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast receivers do not start restricted foreground service types in the methods listed above.
