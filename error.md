# Build Status: RESOLVED ✅

## Previous Issues (Now Fixed):
- ~~Unresolved reference: MindfulnessSessionRecord~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~Unresolved reference: startTime~~ ✅ FIXED  
- ~~Property access issues with Health Connect records~~ ✅ FIXED

## Solution Applied:
1. **Dynamic MindfulnessSessionRecord Support**: Implemented runtime detection of MindfulnessSessionRecord availability using reflection, allowing the app to work with different Health Connect versions.

2. **Fixed Property Access**: Corrected property access for different Health Connect record types:
   - `StepsRecord`, `ActiveCaloriesBurnedRecord`, `SleepSessionRecord`: Use `startTime`/`endTime`
   - `HydrationRecord`, `WeightRecord`: Use reflection to access `time` property safely

3. **Health Connect Version**: Using `androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-alpha07` which provides better compatibility.

## Current Status:
- ✅ Kotlin compilation successful
- ✅ All 6 health data types supported (including MINDFULNESS when available)
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Flutter build running successfully

## Features Restored:
- ✅ MINDFULNESS data type support (meditation, breathing exercises)
- ✅ All original health integration functionality
- ✅ Dynamic feature detection based on Health Connect version

The app now maintains full functionality while being compatible with different versions of Health Connect API.
