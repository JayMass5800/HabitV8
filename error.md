activity reocognition might be a useful one to integrate into our app, perhaps add this to the monitored permissions and add it to our health services to track habits with activity involved.

also when building an apk the system cant find the output files, its because its looking in the wrong folder, can you update the system to look C:\HabitV8\android\app\build\outputs this is where they are all output to.
