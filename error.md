The stats page needs to be updated to work with the new catagories for all sections ,weekly , monthly, yearly ... monthly and yearly need to have a two week and two month delay in showing data at first, they should display a message stating more data needs gathering before analysis will be visible so analysis will be more useful.


The insights pages need updating. Integrate the overview, analytics and insights from the health integration dashboard into the insights pages leave the settings and help sections where they are, update the layout and design it should be general habit focused but with full health data integrated too, however the health data should only show up when health data is activated. Remove the health integration link at the top of the all habits page.


lets expand the suggested category feature on the habit creation page to cover all habit types not just health types. and update the habit edit screen to be a match to the creation screen for consistency and ease of use.

Let's change the health based habit suggestions on the habit creation page to be a drop down section that suggests habits of all types and when health data is activated includes health related habits .
