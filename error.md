 V2 Creation Flow & Habit Functionality Issues
Summary: The V2 habit creation flow presents structural confusion and redundancy. Additionally, core functionality‚Äîspecifically notifications, completion/snooze actions, save times, and background processing‚Äîhas experienced significant regression compared to the previous version.

1. Creation Flow (UX/UI Redundancy & Confusion)
The current V2 screen is overwhelming due to redundant selection layers for creation methods.

üõë Current Problem: Duplicate Selection Layers
Initial Selection: The user is first prompted to select a frequency (Hourly through Yearly).

Secondary Selection (under "Advanced"): After selecting an initial frequency (e.g., Daily) and then selecting the "Advanced" option, the user is presented with Simple and Advanced options again.

The Simple/Advanced Redundancy: The "Simple" setting on the secondary screen appears to be identical to the selection made on the initial frequency screen, creating a confusing, duplicate layer of choice.

‚úÖ Suggested Solution: Streamline the Flow
Recommendation: Remove the initial frequency selection step.

Replace the first step with a direct choice between Simple and Advanced creation methods. This covers all options effectively.

The Simple view should include the older setup for selecting specific hours when the user wants to set an Hourly habit. All other basic frequencies (Daily through Yearly) would be covered under this single "Simple" section.

2. Habit Functionality & Performance Regressions
Key features and performance metrics have degraded in V2.

A. Notification Issues üîî
Problem: Habits set for Daily through Yearly frequencies are sending notifications that are missing crucial interactive elements.

Missing Elements: The notification does not include the Complete and Snooze buttons.

B. Action Button Failures ‚ùå
Problem: The interactive buttons (Complete and potentially Snooze) are not functioning correctly when used, whether on the notification or within the app.

Failure: Users cannot reliably mark habits as completed (or snooze them) using these buttons.

C. Performance & Latency üêå
Habit Saving: The time taken to save a new habit is excessive, often taking 10+ seconds. This was near-instantaneous in the old version.

Background Actions: Background processes, such as updating widgets, are experiencing extreme latency, taking minutes to complete instead of being almost instant as they were previously.

Goal: Restore the streamlined UX of the old creation flow and resolve critical regressions in habit interaction (notifications, completion actions) and overall application performance (save times, background processing).
