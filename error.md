Alarm System Improvements Summary
1. Implemented a Robust Native AlarmService
I created a complete implementation of the AlarmService.kt file, which was previously empty. The new service:

Uses a foreground service with high priority to ensure reliable alarm playback
Implements proper audio attributes for alarm sounds to bypass Do Not Disturb and silent modes
Includes gradual volume increase for a more pleasant wake-up experience
Adds vibration patterns for additional alert effectiveness
Creates a persistent notification that can't be easily dismissed
Handles system sound URIs properly for both system and custom sounds
Acquires wake locks to ensure the CPU stays awake during alarm playback
Properly handles lifecycle events to prevent service termination
2. Fixed Platform Channel Integration
Updated the MainActivity.kt file to properly implement the ALARM_SERVICE_CHANNEL method handler
Ensured proper communication between Dart and native code for alarm control
Added proper error handling and logging for debugging
Implemented service start/stop methods that work reliably
3. Improved Background Alarm Handling
Updated the alarm_callback.dart file to better handle background alarm execution
Added fallback mechanisms when platform channels fail in background isolates
Improved sound URI resolution for system sounds
Enhanced error handling and logging
4. Key Technical Improvements
Reliable Sound Playback:

Uses both MediaPlayer and Ringtone APIs with fallback mechanisms
Sets proper audio attributes to ensure sounds play at full volume
Implements gradual volume increase for a better user experience
Persistent Notifications:

Created notifications that can't be easily dismissed
Added proper action buttons for stopping and snoozing alarms
Ensured notifications survive system UI interactions
System Integration:

Properly handles device reboots
Manages system resources efficiently
Respects Android's battery optimization constraints while still delivering reliable alarms
Error Handling:

Added comprehensive error handling throughout the system
Implemented fallback mechanisms when primary approaches fail
Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
5. User Experience Improvements
Alarms now continue to play even when the notification shade is accessed
User-defined sounds are properly respected and played
Alarms are more reliable and consistent
The system feels more professional with proper visual and audio feedback
These changes address all the issues mentioned in the error files and should significantly improve the reliability and user experience of the alarm system in HabitV8.
