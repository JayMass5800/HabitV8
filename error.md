The issue you're facing is common because background processes on mobile platforms (iOS and Android) are heavily restricted, and Flutter's standard listeners only work while the app is actively running or in the background for a short time. When the app is closed or killed, the listeners stop, and the Isar database is closed. Opening the app initializes everything again, which is why your widget updates.

To get around this and ensure your homescreen widget updates in the morning even if the app hasn't been opened, you need to use Platform-Specific Background Tasks to run a headless Dart function that can open Isar, fetch the data, and update the widget.

Here is the general approach, which involves using a background execution package and coordinating it with your Isar database and widget package (like home_widget or flutter_widgetkit).

1. Implement Background Task Scheduling
You need a package to schedule recurring tasks that run even when your app is terminated.

For Recurring Tasks: Use a package like workmanager (for Android and iOS) or background_fetch (for more control over background fetch cycles). workmanager is often preferred for guaranteed periodic work.

Workmanager Implementation (General Steps)
Add Dependencies:

YAML

dependencies:
  workmanager: ^latest_version
  # Your widget package (e.g., home_widget)
  # isar and isar_flutter_libs
Define the Headless Task:
You must define a top-level static function that will run when the background task is triggered. This function is an entry point for your background process.

Dart

// Must be a top-level function outside any class
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager().executeTask((taskName, inputData) async {
    // 1. Initialize Flutter and Isar
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    // You'll need to open Isar here, likely from a shared path.
    final dir = await getApplicationSupportDirectory();
    final isar = await Isar.open(
      [YourSchema], 
      directory: dir.path,
      // You may need to use a dedicated Isar instance 
      // that doesn't conflict with the main app's instance.
    );

    // 2. Fetch Data from Isar
    final data = await isar.yourCollections.where().findFirst(); 

    // 3. Update the Widget
    if (data != null) {
      // Use your chosen widget package to update the widget
      await HomeWidget.saveWidgetData('isar_data', data.toJson()); 
      await HomeWidget.updateWidget(
        iOSName: 'YourWidgetName',
        androidName: 'YourWidgetProviderName',
      );
    }

    // Return true to mark the task as successful
    return Future.value(true);
  });
}
Initialize Workmanager and Register the Task (in main.dart):

Dart

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await HomeWidget.setAppGroupId('group.com.yourapp'); // Essential for widgets

  Workmanager().initialize(
    callbackDispatcher, // The top-level function defined above
    isInDebugMode: true,
  );

  // Register the task to run every day (e.g., at 7:00 AM)
  Workmanager().registerPeriodicTask(
    "dailyUpdateTask",
    "updateHomescreenWidget",
    // The time should be close to the morning update time you want.
    // For Android, this is an interval; the OS decides the exact time.
    // For a specific time, you might need native alarms (more complex).
    frequency: const Duration(hours: 24),
    initialDelay: calculateInitialDelayForMorning(), // Custom function
    // Constraints can be added here
  );

  runApp(MyApp());
}

// A utility function to calculate the delay until the morning
Duration calculateInitialDelayForMorning() {
  final now = DateTime.now();
  final desiredTime = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day, 7, 0, 0); // 7:00 AM

  // If the desired time has already passed today, schedule for tomorrow
  final nextRunTime = (now.isAfter(desiredTime))
      ? desiredTime.add(const Duration(days: 1))
      : desiredTime;

  return nextRunTime.difference(now);
}
2. Isar Access in Background
The main challenge is that Isar is not automatically available in your headless task. You need to ensure the Isar instance is opened correctly within your background function.

Key Considerations for Isar
Directory Path: You must use a consistent, accessible path for your Isar database, both in the main app and the background task. The path_provider package's getApplicationSupportDirectory() is generally reliable, but ensure the path is correctly resolved in the background context.

App Groups (iOS): For iOS widgets and background tasks to share data (like the Isar database path or the widget data), you must configure App Groups in Xcode.

Go to your app target and the widget extension target in Xcode.

Under Signing & Capabilities, add the App Groups capability.

Create and select a group identifier (e.g., group.com.yourapp).

Isar Initialization: Your callbackDispatcher needs to call Isar.open to initialize and open the database before fetching data.

3. Native Widget Configuration
Remember that Flutter only handles the Dart logic for sending the update. The native side (the Widget Extension in iOS or the AppWidgetProvider in Android) must be configured to receive and display the data.

Android
In your AppWidgetProvider XML, you can set the android:updatePeriodMillis to a non-zero value (e.g., 3600000 for 1 hour) as a fallback, but the update from your background task will be the primary mechanism.

The workmanager task will directly call the necessary native code to update the widget.

iOS
iOS widgets primarily use a TimelineProvider to determine when to refresh.

When your background task runs and calls HomeWidget.updateWidget(), it signals the native widget extension to update its timeline.

For time-based updates, you might need to combine workmanager with the native WidgetKit's timeline-setting capabilities to ensure the widget is updated even if the workmanager task is delayed by the OS. For instance, in the native iOS extension's getTimeline function, you can set a refresh date for the next morning.

By using a package like workmanager, you move the logic to a secure, OS-scheduled background process, ensuring your data is fetched from Isar and your homescreen widget is updated independent of whether the user opens the main application.
