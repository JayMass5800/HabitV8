## Security Features

HabitV8 is designed with security and privacy as core principles:

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: All user data is stored locally on the device using encrypted Hive database
- **No Cloud Dependency**: No personal data is transmitted to external servers
- **Encryption**: Local data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods
- **Data Ownership**: Users have complete control over their data

### Privacy by Design
- **Minimal Data Collection**: We collect no personal identifiers or usage analytics
- **No Tracking**: No user behavior tracking or analytics sent to external services
- **Transparent Permissions**: All requested permissions are clearly explained and optional
- **GDPR Compliant**: Full compliance with European data protection regulations

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regular updates to dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis to identify potential security issues
- **Minimal Permissions**: App requests only necessary permissions for functionality
