# Widget Background Service - NOT NEEDED

This file was created during investigation but is **NOT REQUIRED** for the solution.

## Why It's Not Needed

The original problem was misunderstood. The actual issue was:
- Widgets were **not updating instantly** when habits were completed from notification buttons (before app was opened)
- NOT that widgets needed scheduled morning updates

## Actual Solution

The fix was implemented in `notification_action_handler.dart`:
- Added `_updateWidgetsInBackground()` method
- Directly updates widget data when notification completion happens
- Works even when app is closed
- Provides **instant updates** instead of scheduled updates

## File Status

This `widget_background_service.dart` file got corrupted during implementation and should be **deleted**.

The correct fix is documented in: `WIDGET_INSTANT_UPDATE_FIX.md`

To remove this file:
```powershell
Remove-Item "c:\HabitV8\lib\services\widget_background_service.dart" -Force
```
