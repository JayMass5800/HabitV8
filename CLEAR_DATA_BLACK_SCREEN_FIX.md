# Clear All Data Black Screen Fix - Updated

## Problem Description
After the initial fix, a new issue emerged: when using the "clear all data" feature, the All Habits screen cleared correctly but the Timeline screen didn't refresh properly, and there were persistent Hive errors from multiple `forceImmediateRefresh` calls trying to access the closed database.

### Root Cause Analysis (Updated)

The new issue occurred because:

1. **Race Condition with Force Refresh**: After database reset and navigation to `/`, multiple UI components (Timeline, All Habits screens) triggered `forceImmediateRefresh()` calls
2. **Provider Invalidation Timing**: Even though providers were invalidated, old instances or new instances were still trying to access the closed database
3. **Timeline Screen Not Refreshing**: The Timeline screen specifically was not properly initializing with empty data after the reset

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. Database Reset State Management
**File: `lib/data/database.dart`**

Added a static flag to track database reset state and prevent refresh attempts during reset:

```dart
class HabitsNotifier extends StateNotifier<HabitsState> {
  // ... existing code ...
  static bool _databaseResetInProgress = false; // Track database reset state

  // Static methods to control database reset state
  static void markDatabaseResetInProgress() {
    _databaseResetInProgress = true;
  }

  static void markDatabaseResetComplete() {
    _databaseResetInProgress = false;
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Force Refresh Protection
Modified `forceImmediateRefresh()` to skip execution during database reset:

```dart
Future<void> forceImmediateRefresh() async {
  // Skip refresh if database reset is in progress
  if (_databaseResetInProgress) {
    AppLogger.debug('Skipping force refresh - database reset in progress');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of method
}
```

### 3. Protected Periodic Updates
Enhanced `_checkForUpdates()` to skip checks during reset:

```dart
Future<void> _checkForUpdates() async {
  // Skip check if database reset is in progress
  if (_databaseResetInProgress) {
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of method
}
```

### 4. Improved Clear Data Sequence
**File: `lib/ui/screens/settings_screen.dart`**

Enhanced the clear data process with proper state management:

```dart
// Mark database reset as in progress to prevent refresh attempts
HabitsNotifier.markDatabaseResetInProgress();

// Invalidate providers BEFORE resetting database
if (mounted) {
  ref.invalidate(habitServiceProvider);
  ref.invalidate(databaseProvider);
  AppLogger.info('Providers invalidated');
}

// Small delay to allow providers to clean up properly
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 200));

// Reset the database
await DatabaseService.resetDatabase();
AppLogger.info('Database reset completed');

// Mark reset as complete
HabitsNotifier.markDatabaseResetComplete();

// Additional delay to ensure database is properly closed
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 300));

// Navigate to reset navigation stack
context.go('/');
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
Added proper cleanup in error scenarios:

```dart
} catch (e) {
  AppLogger.error('Failed to clear all data', e);

  // Mark reset as complete even on error
  HabitsNotifier.markDatabaseResetComplete();

  // ... error handling
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Prevents Race Conditions**: Static flag prevents multiple refresh attempts during reset
2. **Timeline Screen Fix**: Proper provider invalidation and state management ensures Timeline refreshes correctly
3. **Eliminates Hive Errors**: Database access is blocked during reset process
4. **Graceful State Transitions**: Proper delays allow for clean provider cleanup and re-initialization
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Reset state is properly managed even in error scenarios

## Testing Results

✅ **Clear Data Success**: Data is cleared completely
✅ **All Habits Screen**: Refreshes correctly to empty state  
✅ **Timeline Screen**: Now refreshes correctly to empty state
✅ **No Hive Errors**: "Box has already been closed" errors eliminated
✅ **Proper Navigation**: Smooth transition back to main screen
✅ **Success Feedback**: User sees confirmation message

## Error Logs Analysis

**Before Fix:**
```
🐛 Database was reset, stopping periodic refresh: HiveError: Box has already been closed.
💡 🚀 Force immediate habits refresh triggered
💡 ✅ Force immediate habits refresh completed
[Multiple repeat cycles of above]
```

**After Fix:**
```
💡 Providers invalidated
💡 Database reset completed
💡 Database reset completed
[Clean navigation with no Hive errors]
```
