# Tomorrow's Habit Count Bug Fix

## Problem
The widget celebration message was showing "Great work! Keep up the momentum!" (indicating 0 habits tomorrow) even when there were actually 6 habits scheduled for tomorrow.

## Root Cause
Found a critical bug in `_isHabitActiveOnDate()` in `lib/services/widget_service.dart`:

### Bug in Weekly Frequency Check (Line 174-178)
```dart
case HabitFrequency.weekly:
  final habitWeekday = habit.selectedWeekdays.isNotEmpty
      ? habit.selectedWeekdays.first  // ❌ BUG: Only checks FIRST weekday!
      : DateTime.sunday;
  return date.weekday == habitWeekday;
```

**Problem**: The code only checked the **first** selected weekday, but habits can have **multiple** weekdays selected (e.g., Mon-Fri for weekday habits).

**Impact**: If a habit was scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, but the code only checked Monday, it would incorrectly return `false` for all other days.

### Same Bug in Monthly Frequency (Line 180-183)
```dart
case HabitFrequency.monthly:
  final habitDay = habit.selectedMonthDays.isNotEmpty
      ? habit.selectedMonthDays.first  // ❌ BUG: Only checks FIRST day!
      : 1;
  return date.day == habitDay;
```

**Same Issue**: Only checked the first selected day of the month, ignoring other selected days.

## Solution

### Fixed Weekly Frequency Check
```dart
case HabitFrequency.weekly:
  // Check if the date's weekday matches ANY of the selected weekdays
  if (habit.selectedWeekdays.isEmpty) {
    return date.weekday == DateTime.sunday; // Default to Sunday if none selected
  }
  return habit.selectedWeekdays.contains(date.weekday);
```

### Fixed Monthly Frequency Check
```dart
case HabitFrequency.monthly:
  // Check if the date's day matches ANY of the selected month days
  if (habit.selectedMonthDays.isEmpty) {
    return date.day == 1; // Default to 1st if none selected
  }
  return habit.selectedMonthDays.contains(date.day);
```

## Additional Debug Logging Added

To help diagnose issues in the future, added comprehensive logging:

### In `updateWidgetData()` (Lines 56-60)
```dart
AppLogger.info('Widget update: date=$date, today habits=${relevantHabits.length}, tomorrow=$tomorrow, tomorrow habits=$tomorrowCount');
if (tomorrowCount > 0) {
  AppLogger.info('Tomorrow habits: ${tomorrowHabits.map((h) => h.name).join(", ")}');
}
```

### When Saving Widget Data (Lines 79-81)
```dart
AppLogger.info('Widget data prepared: tomorrowHabitCount=$tomorrowCount');
// ... save to SharedPreferences ...
AppLogger.info('Widget data saved to SharedPreferences with key: $_habitsDataKey');
```

## Files Modified

1. **lib/services/widget_service.dart**
   - Fixed `_isHabitActiveOnDate()` weekly frequency check (line ~174)
   - Fixed `_isHabitActiveOnDate()` monthly frequency check (line ~180)
   - Added debug logging for tomorrow's habit count calculation

## Testing Instructions

1. Build and install the new APK:
   ```powershell
   flutter build apk --release
   adb install -r build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
   ```

2. Create test habits:
   - At least one daily habit
   - At least one weekday-only habit (Mon-Fri)
   - Optional: one weekend-only habit (Sat-Sun)

3. Complete all today's habits

4. Check the widget celebration message:
   - If tomorrow is a weekday: Should show count including weekday habits
   - If tomorrow is weekend: Should show count excluding weekday habits (unless weekend habits exist)

5. Check logcat for tomorrow count:
   ```powershell
   adb logcat -s "flutter:I" | Select-String "tomorrow"
   ```

   Should show:
   ```
   Widget update: date=..., today habits=X, tomorrow=..., tomorrow habits=6
   Tomorrow habits: Habit1, Habit2, Habit3, Habit4, Habit5, Habit6
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### Example Scenario
- **Today**: Monday with 6 habits (5 weekday + 1 daily)
- **Tomorrow**: Tuesday with 6 habits (same 5 weekday + 1 daily)
- **Celebration Message**: "Ready to tackle tomorrow's **6** habits" ✅

### Example Scenario 2  
- **Today**: Friday with 6 habits (5 weekday + 1 daily)
- **Tomorrow**: Saturday with 1 habit (only the daily one)
- **Celebration Message**: "Ready to tackle tomorrow's **1** habit" ✅

### Example Scenario 3
- **Today**: Saturday with 1 habit
- **Tomorrow**: Sunday with 0 habits
- **Celebration Message**: "Great work! Keep up the momentum!" ✅

## Why This Bug Existed

This bug was likely introduced early in development when habits only supported single-day selection for weekly/monthly frequencies. When multi-select was added later, this particular check in `widget_service.dart` was not updated to use `.contains()` instead of checking `.first`.

## Impact

**HIGH** - This bug affected:
- Widget celebration messages (showing incorrect tomorrow count)
- Potentially widget habit display (if filtering by date for widgets)
- User motivation and planning (incorrect information about upcoming habits)

## Related Code

This same pattern might exist in other files that filter habits by date. Should check:
- `lib/ui/screens/calendar_screen.dart`
- `lib/ui/screens/timeline_screen.dart`
- Any other code that calls `_isHabitActiveOnDate()` or similar logic

Note: Most other screens use `RRuleService` or the main `HabitService` which have the correct multi-day logic.
