# Alarm Notification Permission Fix

## Problem Summary
Alarm notifications were not appearing when alarms fired, even though the alarm sound was playing correctly.

## Root Cause
After investigation with comprehensive logging, we discovered:

1. **Notifications were disabled at the system level** for the app
2. **Permission request was missing** - The app was not requesting notification permission when users created alarm-type habits
3. The `NotificationAlarmScheduler` did not call `ensureNotificationPermissions()` before scheduling alarms

## Key Diagnostic Logs
```
D AlarmService: üì¢ Notifications enabled for app: false
E AlarmService: ‚ùå NOTIFICATIONS ARE DISABLED FOR THIS APP!
```

Even though the alarm service was:
- ‚úÖ Creating notification channels successfully
- ‚úÖ Building notifications with action buttons
- ‚úÖ Calling `startForeground()` with the notification
- ‚úÖ Playing alarm sounds and vibrations

Android was blocking the notification because the app didn't have notification permission.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Permission Request to Alarm Scheduler
**File**: `lib/services/notifications/notification_alarm_scheduler.dart`

Added a call to `NotificationCore.ensureNotificationPermissions()` at the beginning of `scheduleHabitAlarms()`:

```dart
Future<void> scheduleHabitAlarms(Habit habit) async {
  // Skip if alarms are disabled
  if (!habit.alarmEnabled) {
    return;
  }

  // Request notification permissions before scheduling alarms
  AppLogger.info('üîî Checking notification permissions before scheduling alarm...');
  final bool hasPermission =
      await NotificationCore.ensureNotificationPermissions();
  if (!hasPermission) {
    AppLogger.warning(
      '‚ö†Ô∏è Notification permission denied - alarm will fire but notification may not show',
    );
    // Continue anyway - the alarm will still fire and play sound
  }
  
  // ... rest of alarm scheduling code
}
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Diagnostic Logging
**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/AlarmService.kt`

Added detailed logging throughout the notification creation process:
- Channel creation verification
- Notification permission status check
- Notification build confirmation
- Foreground service start confirmation

This helped us identify the exact point of failure.

## How It Works Now

### When Creating an Alarm-Type Habit:

1. User enables "Alarm" toggle in habit creation screen
2. User taps "Create Habit"
3. **App requests notification permission** (if not already granted)
4. User sees system dialog: "Allow HabitV8 to send notifications?"
5. User taps "Allow"
6. Alarm is scheduled successfully
7. When alarm fires:
   - ‚úÖ Notification appears with COMPLETE and SNOOZE buttons
   - ‚úÖ Alarm sound plays
   - ‚úÖ Phone vibrates
   - ‚úÖ User can interact with notification actions

## User Experience

### First Alarm Habit:
- Permission dialog appears automatically when creating the habit
- Clear context: user knows WHY they're granting permission

### Subsequent Alarm Habits:
- No permission dialog (already granted)
- Alarms work immediately

### If Permission Denied:
- Alarm still fires with sound and vibration
- But no visible notification appears
- User can manually enable in Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí HabitV8 ‚Üí Notifications

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create first alarm habit ‚Üí Permission dialog appears
- [x] Grant permission ‚Üí Notification shows when alarm fires
- [x] Complete button stops alarm and marks habit complete
- [x] Snooze button stops alarm and reschedules for 10 minutes
- [x] Alarm plays correct sound
- [x] Alarm vibrates
- [x] Foreground service notification persists during alarm

## Files Modified

1. `lib/services/notifications/notification_alarm_scheduler.dart`
   - Added `NotificationCore.ensureNotificationPermissions()` call
   - Added import for `notification_core.dart`

2. `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/habittracker/habitv8/AlarmService.kt`
   - Added comprehensive logging for notification creation
   - Added notification permission status check
   - Added notification channel verification

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also ensures:
- Exact alarm permissions are requested (Android 12+)
- User gets clear context for why permissions are needed
- Permissions are requested at the right time (when enabling features)
- Not requested at app startup (Android 13+ best practice)

## Notes

- The `ensureNotificationPermissions()` method handles both notification permission and exact alarm permission
- It uses a contextual approach with user-friendly dialogs
- Permissions are only requested when actually needed (not on startup)
- This follows Android 13+ best practices for notification permissions
