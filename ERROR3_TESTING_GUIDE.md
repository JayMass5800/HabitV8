## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Complete" button doesn't mark habit
**Symptoms:** Tap complete on notification, nothing happens
**Check:**
```
adb logcat | grep "NotificationAction"
```
Look for:
- `‚úÖ Notification action callback is properly registered`
- `‚úÖ Using callback to process pending actions`

**Solution:** 
- Restart app (callback re-registers on startup)
- Check `NotificationStorage` - action may be pending for next app launch

---

### Issue: "Enable Alarms" switch is grayed out
**Symptoms:** Can't toggle alarm switch
**Check:** File `create_habit_screen_v2.dart` line 62
**Should be:** `bool _alarmEnabled = false;`
**NOT:** `final bool _alarmEnabled = false;`

---

### Issue: No habit suggestions appear
**Symptoms:** Suggestions card never shows
**Check:**
```dart
// In create_habit_screen_v2.dart
if (_habitSuggestions.isNotEmpty) ...
```
**Possible causes:**
- `ComprehensiveHabitSuggestionsService` failing to load
- Network/permission issues (if suggestions use health data)
- Service not initialized

**Debug:**
```
adb logcat | grep "HabitSuggestion"
```

---

### Issue: Advanced mode crashes on "One-time" frequency
**Symptoms:** App crashes with dropdown assertion error
**Check:** File `rrule_builder_widget.dart` around line 395
**Should have:**
```dart
if (!widget.forceAdvancedMode) ...[
  _buildFrequencySelector(),
  const SizedBox(height: 16),
],
```

---

## üìä Verification Commands

### Check notification callback status:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "callback|NotificationAction"
```

### Check alarm permissions:
```bash
adb shell dumpsys alarm | grep HabitV8
```

### Check pending notifications:
```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification | grep HabitV8
```

### Clear app data for fresh test:
```bash
adb shell pm clear com.habittracker.habitv8
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

All fixes successful when:
- ‚úÖ Notification complete/snooze marks habits
- ‚úÖ Alarm toggle works in V2 creation screen
- ‚úÖ Alarm sound picker shows and plays sounds
- ‚úÖ Habit suggestions load and apply correctly
- ‚úÖ Advanced mode doesn't crash on any frequency
- ‚úÖ No duplicate frequency selectors in advanced mode

---

## üìù Notes

- **Alarms and Notifications are mutually exclusive** - enabling one disables the other
- **Habit suggestions** may take 1-2 seconds to load on first app launch
- **Advanced mode frequency dropdown** should ONLY appear when `forceAdvancedMode: false` (standalone use)
- **Notification actions** use fallback storage system if callback isn't ready
