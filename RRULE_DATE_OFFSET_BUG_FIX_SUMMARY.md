# RRule Date Offset Bug Fix - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED - October 5, 2025

### Bug Fixed
**Title:** Calendar/Timeline: RRule Refactor causes incorrect day offsets (displaying day before) for recurring habits

**Symptoms:**
- Monthly habits (e.g., 5th, 10th, 15th) showing on 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, 14th, 15th
- Weekly habits (e.g., Monday) showing on Sunday and Monday
- All RRule frequency types affected

**Priority:** HIGH (Core functionality/data integrity)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **lib/services/rrule_service.dart**
   - Fixed `isDueOnDate()` method (lines 233-257)
   - Fixed `getOccurrences()` method (lines 180-230)

### Changes Made

#### 1. isDueOnDate() Method
**Before:**
```dart
final dayStart = DateTime(checkDate.year, checkDate.month, checkDate.day);
final dayEnd = dayStart.add(const Duration(days: 1));
```

**After:**
```dart
final dayStartUtc = DateTime.utc(checkDate.year, checkDate.month, checkDate.day);
final dayEndUtc = DateTime.utc(checkDate.year, checkDate.month, checkDate.day, 23, 59, 59);
```

**Impact:** Ensures we check exactly ONE day (00:00:00 to 23:59:59) in UTC, not bleeding into the next day.

#### 2. getOccurrences() Method
**Before:**
```dart
final rangeStartUtc = DateTime.utc(rangeStart.year, rangeStart.month, rangeStart.day);
final rangeEndUtc = DateTime.utc(rangeEnd.year, rangeEnd.month, rangeEnd.day, 23, 59, 59);
```

**After:**
```dart
final rangeStartUtc = rangeStart.isUtc
    ? rangeStart
    : DateTime.utc(rangeStart.year, rangeStart.month, rangeStart.day);

final rangeEndUtc = rangeEnd.isUtc
    ? rangeEnd
    : DateTime.utc(rangeEnd.year, rangeEnd.month, rangeEnd.day, 23, 59, 59);
```

**Impact:** Respects UTC DateTimes with time components already set, prevents double-conversion.

### Files Created
1. **test/rrule_date_offset_bug_test.dart** - Comprehensive test suite (4 test cases)
2. **RRULE_DATE_OFFSET_FIX.md** - Technical documentation

### Files Updated
1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Added entry for this fix

## Testing Results

### New Tests Created ✅
- Monthly habit precision test (7 assertions)
- Weekly habit precision test (4 assertions)
- Daily habit test (10 assertions)
- Occurrence exact date verification (4 assertions)

**All 4 new tests PASS**

### Regression Testing ✅
- All 12 existing RRule tests PASS
- All 54 total project tests PASS

### No Breaking Changes ✅
- No API changes
- No data migration required
- Legacy frequency logic unaffected

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
1. **Incorrect date range:** `isDueOnDate()` was checking Oct 5 00:00 → Oct 6 00:00 (local)
2. **Double-conversion:** `getOccurrences()` converted to UTC and added time, resulting in Oct 5 00:00 UTC → Oct 6 23:59:59 UTC
3. **Result:** Checking nearly 2 full days instead of just 1 day

### The Solution
1. **UTC from start:** Use UTC DateTimes immediately, not local → UTC conversion
2. **Explicit boundaries:** Set 23:59:59 on the SAME day, not the next day
3. **Respect existing UTC:** Don't re-convert DateTimes that are already in UTC

## Verification Steps

### Automated Testing
```powershell
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test files
flutter test test/rrule_date_offset_bug_test.dart
flutter test test/services/rrule_service_test.dart
```
**Result:** All 54 tests PASS ✅

### Manual Testing Checklist
Recommended for final verification:
- [ ] Create monthly habit for days 5, 10, 15
- [ ] Verify Calendar shows ONLY on those days
- [ ] Verify Timeline shows ONLY on those days
- [ ] Create weekly habit for Monday
- [ ] Verify Calendar shows ONLY on Monday
- [ ] Verify Timeline shows ONLY on Monday
- [ ] Create daily habit
- [ ] Verify shows every day on both screens

## Impact Assessment

### Screens Automatically Fixed
- ✅ Calendar Screen (lib/ui/screens/calendar_screen.dart)
- ✅ Timeline Screen (lib/ui/screens/timeline_screen.dart)
- ✅ Any screen calling `RRuleService.isDueOnDate()`

### User-Visible Changes
- Habits now display on CORRECT days only
- No more phantom habit occurrences on adjacent days
- Consistent behavior across all RRule frequency types

### Technical Debt
- **Reduced:** Fixed core date calculation logic
- **Documentation:** Added comprehensive technical docs
- **Test Coverage:** Added targeted regression tests

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. ✅ Merge to feature branch (feature/rrule-refactoring)
2. ⏳ Perform manual testing (see checklist above)
3. ⏳ Test on physical device with real habits
4. ⏳ Merge to master when verified
5. ⏳ Include in next release build

### Monitoring
- Watch for any user reports of incorrect habit display
- Monitor test suite for any regressions
- Verify RRule calculations remain correct across timezones
