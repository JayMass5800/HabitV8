## Complete Conversation Summary
The user encountered critical Health Connect API compatibility issues in their Flutter habit tracking app (HabitV8). The error logs showed `NoSuchMethodError` for methods like `getStartZoneOffset()` in `SleepSessionRecord` and similar compatibility problems across all health data types. This indicated that the native Android plugin was trying to use Health Connect API methods that don't exist in the current version installed on the device.

I analyzed the existing codebase and identified that the problem was in the native Kotlin plugin (`MinimalHealthPlugin.kt`) which was using unstable or version-specific Health Connect API calls. The original implementation was complex and tried to use advanced features that weren't universally available across different Health Connect versions.

**Key Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Complete Rewrite of MinimalHealthChannel (Dart)**: Created a new, simplified Dart service that focuses on reliability and compatibility. The new design uses only stable Health Connect APIs and implements graceful degradation for unsupported features. It separates core data types (universally supported) from extended data types (may not be available on all versions).

2. **Complete Rewrite of MinimalHealthPlugin (Kotlin)**: Rewrote the native Android plugin to use only stable, well-tested Health Connect API methods. The new implementation avoids problematic API calls that cause compatibility issues and includes comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms.

3. **Simplified HealthService Integration**: Updated the main `HealthService` to work seamlessly with the new `MinimalHealthChannel`, removing complex validation logic and streamlining the initialization process.

4. **Compatibility Mode**: Implemented a compatibility mode that uses only the most stable API calls when dealing with potentially problematic data types like sleep sessions.

**Technical Approach:**
- Used only core Health Connect data types (STEPS, ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED, TOTAL_CALORIES_BURNED, HEART_RATE, WATER, WEIGHT) as the foundation
- Implemented dynamic detection for extended data types (SLEEP_IN_BED, MINDFULNESS) with graceful fallback
- Added comprehensive error handling and timeout mechanisms
- Implemented robust record conversion that avoids version-specific method calls
- Created diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

**Files Modified:**
- Completely rewrote `c:\HabitV8\lib\services\minimal_health_channel.dart` (395 lines)
- Completely rewrote `c:\HabitV8\android\app\src\main\kotlin\com\habittracker\habitv8\MinimalHealthPlugin.kt` (1000+ lines)
- Updated `c:\HabitV8\lib\services\health_service.dart` to integrate with the new channel
- Created test script `c:\HabitV8\test_new_health_channel.dart` for validation

**Key Design Principles:**
- Maximum compatibility across Health Connect versions
- Graceful degradation when features aren't available
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Simple, predictable behavior
- Full compatibility across Android versions

The solution maintains all original functionality while ensuring robust compatibility with different Health Connect versions. The new implementation should resolve the `NoSuchMethodError` issues by avoiding problematic API calls and using only stable, universally supported methods.
