# Alarm Notification Not Showing - Fix

## Problem
After implementing the alarm complete and snooze features, alarms were firing and playing sound but **NO NOTIFICATION was visible** to the user. This meant users couldn't stop or interact with the alarm.

## Root Cause
The issue was that we were creating **TWO separate notifications**:

1. **Foreground Service Notification** (ID: 1001)
   - Required for the AlarmService to run as a foreground service
   - Shown via `startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, createNotification())`
   - Had a "Stop Alarm" button

2. **Alarm Notification** (ID: alarmId + 2000)  
   - Shown separately via `notificationManager.notify()`
   - Had "COMPLETE" and "SNOOZE" buttons
   - **This notification was NOT appearing!**

### Why the Second Notification Wasn't Showing

Possible reasons:
- Android may suppress duplicate notifications for the same service
- Notification channel conflicts
- The second notification might be getting blocked by the system
- Timing issues (second notification shown after foreground notification)
- Missing notification permissions (though foreground notification worked)

## Solution

**Use only ONE notification** - the foreground service notification - and add the action buttons to it!

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `createNotification()` 
Added COMPLETE and SNOOZE action buttons to the foreground service notification:

```kotlin
private fun createNotification(): Notification {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Create intent to complete alarm
    val completeIntent = Intent(this, AlarmActionReceiver::class.java).apply {
        action = AlarmActionReceiver.ACTION_COMPLETE
        // ... extras ...
    }
    
    // Create intent to snooze alarm
    val snoozeIntent = Intent(this, AlarmActionReceiver::class.java).apply {
        action = AlarmActionReceiver.ACTION_SNOOZE
        // ... extras ...
    }
    
    return NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
        .setContentTitle("üîî $habitName")
        .setContentText("Alarm is ringing - Tap to open app")
        // ... other settings ...
        .addAction(ic_menu_close_clear_cancel, "‚úÖ COMPLETE", completePendingIntent)
        .addAction(ic_menu_recent_history, "‚è∞ SNOOZE", snoozePendingIntent)
        .build()
}
```

#### 2. Removed Separate Notification Call
In `onStartCommand()`, removed the call to `showAlarmNotification()`:

```kotlin
// Before:
showAlarmNotification(alarmId)

// After:
// Note: We don't need to call showAlarmNotification() separately
// The foreground notification already has the action buttons
```

#### 3. Commented Out `showAlarmNotification()` Method
Kept the method as a comment for reference but it's no longer used.

#### 4. Simplified `onDestroy()`
Removed manual notification cancellation since the foreground notification is automatically dismissed when the service stops.

## Result

Now there is **only ONE notification** that:
- ‚úÖ Shows immediately when alarm fires
- ‚úÖ Has the habit name in the title
- ‚úÖ Has TWO action buttons: "‚úÖ COMPLETE" and "‚è∞ SNOOZE"
- ‚úÖ Keeps the service running as a foreground service
- ‚úÖ Automatically dismisses when the alarm is stopped
- ‚úÖ Works consistently across all Android versions

## Testing

When you connect your device and install the debug APK:

1. **Create an alarm-type habit** for a few minutes in the future
2. **Wait for alarm to fire**
3. **You should now see**:
   - ‚úÖ Alarm sound playing
   - ‚úÖ Device vibrating
   - ‚úÖ **ONE notification visible** with habit name
   - ‚úÖ Two buttons: "‚úÖ COMPLETE" and "‚è∞ SNOOZE"

4. **Test the buttons**:
   - Tap "‚úÖ COMPLETE" ‚Üí Alarm stops, habit marked complete
   - Tap "‚è∞ SNOOZE" ‚Üí Alarm stops, reschedules for 10 min later

## Why This Approach is Better

1. **Simplicity**: One notification instead of two
2. **Reliability**: Foreground service notifications always show
3. **Consistency**: No conflicts between multiple notifications
4. **Clean UX**: Users see exactly one notification, not confused by duplicates
5. **System Compliance**: Follows Android's foreground service requirements

## Files Changed

- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../AlarmService.kt`
  - Modified `createNotification()` to include action buttons
  - Removed call to `showAlarmNotification()` in `onStartCommand()`
  - Commented out unused `showAlarmNotification()` method
  - Simplified `onDestroy()` method

## Related Issues

This fixes the issue where users reported:
- "Alarms firing but no notification showing"
- "Can't stop alarms because no notification appears"
- "Alarm plays sound but nothing visible on screen"

## Previous Documentation

- `ALARM_NOTIFICATION_FIX.md` - Initial implementation (had the dual notification issue)
- `ALARM_SNOOZE_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Added snooze functionality
- `ALARM_COMPLETE_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Added complete functionality

This fix supersedes the approach in ALARM_NOTIFICATION_FIX.md by consolidating into a single notification.
