# Android 16 KB Native Library Alignment Fix

## Issue
Google Play Store recommended: "Recompile your app with 16 KB native library alignment"

## Background
Starting with Android 15 (API level 35), the Android runtime requires native libraries to be aligned to 16 KB boundaries in memory. This optimization improves app performance and reduces memory usage.

## Solution Implemented
Added the following configuration to `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
packagingOptions {
    jniLibs {
        useLegacyPackaging = false
    }
}
```

## Technical Details
- **useLegacyPackaging = false**: Enables the new packaging format that aligns native libraries to 16 KB boundaries
- This change is required for apps targeting Android 15 (API 35) and newer
- The fix ensures compatibility with Google Play Store requirements
- No code changes needed in Dart/Flutter - this is purely an Android build configuration

## Requirements Met
- ✅ Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.0+ (we have 8.10.0)
- ✅ Target SDK 35+ (we target SDK 36)
- ✅ Proper jniLibs configuration added

## Testing
After implementing this fix:
1. Clean and rebuild the app
2. Generate a new AAB/APK
3. Upload to Google Play Console to verify the warning is resolved

## Build Commands
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves Google Play Store warning
- ✅ Improves app performance on Android 15+
- ✅ Reduces memory footprint
- ✅ Future-proofs the app for newer Android versions
