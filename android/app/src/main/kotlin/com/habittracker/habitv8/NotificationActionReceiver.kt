/**
 * Pre-warms the Flutter engine before notification actions are processed.
 * 
 * This receiver has HIGHER PRIORITY than flutter_local_notifications'
 * ActionBroadcastReceiver, so it receives the broadcast first and can prepare
 * the Flutter engine before the Dart background handler needs to execute.
 * 
 * CRITICAL: This solves the issue where the Dart background isolate fails to
 * start when the app is completely killed. By starting the Flutter engine
 * proactively, we ensure the background handler can execute successfully.
