# Alarm Notification Fix

## Problem
After the refactor of `notification_service.dart`, alarm-type habits were firing at the correct time with the correct sound, but **no notification was being shown** that the user could interact with to stop the alarm. The alarm would play sound and vibrate, but there was no way to complete or snooze it without opening the app.

## Root Cause
The `AlarmService.kt` (the foreground service that plays alarm sounds) was only creating a simple foreground service notification required for Android to keep the service running. It wasn't creating an actual interactive alarm notification with action buttons.

## Solution
Modified `AlarmService.kt` to show **two notifications**:

1. **Foreground Service Notification** (ID: 1001)
   - Required by Android to keep the service running
   - Shows habit name in the title
   - Has a "Stop Alarm" action button
   - Cannot be dismissed by swiping (ongoing)

2. **Interactive Alarm Notification** (ID: alarmId + 2000)
   - NEW: Added this notification specifically for user interaction
   - Shows habit name: "üîî {habitName}"
   - Has two action buttons:
     - ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Stops the alarm
     - ‚è∞ SNOOZE - Stops the alarm (snooze functionality can be enhanced later)
   - Can be dismissed by tapping
   - Uses high priority and alarm category

## Changes Made

### AlarmService.kt
1. Added `alarmId` as a class property to track the current alarm
2. Modified `createNotification()` to show the habit name in the title
3. Added `showAlarmNotification()` method to create the interactive alarm notification
4. Called `showAlarmNotification()` after starting sound and vibration
5. Updated `onDestroy()` to dismiss the alarm notification when the service stops

## How It Works
1. When an alarm fires, `AlarmReceiver` starts `AlarmService`
2. `AlarmService` starts as a foreground service with notification #1
3. `AlarmService` plays the alarm sound and vibrates
4. `AlarmService` shows the interactive alarm notification #2 with action buttons
5. User can tap "COMPLETE" or "SNOOZE" to stop the alarm
6. When the service stops, both notifications are dismissed

## Testing
1. Create or edit a habit with alarm enabled
2. Set alarm time to a few minutes in the future
3. Wait for alarm to fire
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Alarm sound plays
   - ‚úÖ Device vibrates
   - ‚úÖ Notification shows with habit name
   - ‚úÖ "COMPLETE" button stops the alarm
   - ‚úÖ "SNOOZE" button stops the alarm (currently same as complete)
   - ‚úÖ Notifications are dismissed when alarm is stopped

## Future Enhancements
- Implement proper snooze functionality (reschedule alarm after X minutes)
- Add habit completion logic when "COMPLETE" is tapped
- Customize notification icons
- Add full-screen intent for critical alarms
